## Introduction

Welcome to Mordheim, City of the Damned! Mordheim is a
game of combat that takes place during the short but intense
period when scores of warbands fought hundreds of bitter
skirmishes throughout the city.
This book contains all the information you will need in order
to play Mordheim, as well as background information, advice
on starting a warband, running a campaign, collecting and
painting your own warband, etc.

## Tabletop conflict

In Mordheim, the opposing factions – warbands – are
represented by models, assembled and painted by you, each
representing a single warrior.
Your tabletop becomes part of the City of the Damned: the
scene of the action, with ruined buildings, overhangs and
walkways where the battles take place.
The aim of the game is to outfight your opponent, which
requires a mixture of skill and luck. You’ll soon learn how to
arm and equip your warband effectively, and how to exploit
the ruins and other terrain to your best advantage.
You’ll probably want to expand your basic warband as you
and they gain experience. This is easy as there are lots of
models available for the warbands and new miniatures will be
coming out all the time. With these you can expand your

```
warband, equip your warriors with different weapons and
armour, and hire mercenaries to join them.
```
## Building a warband

```
At first you will probably want to play individual games (see
the Warbands section for more details) rather than a
campaign. This will allow you to learn the rules, and also
give you the opportunity to decide which type of warband is
most suited to your particular style of play.
If you are playing in a campaign, you will have the chance to
expand and improve your warband after each game. By
winning battles your warband will gain riches and wyrdstone,
discover magical artefacts and may also have the opportunity
to recruit mercenaries.
In a campaign, every time your warband fights, its warriors
gain in skill and experience. Raw recruits quickly progress to
become fully fledged warriors, and your Heroes will learn
new skills which will make them even better in combat.
Each warband has its own objective and motivation for
fighting in Mordheim: be it riches or political influence.
Through countless battles and street skirmishes you can try to
achieve your ambition and emerge victorious from the city!

#### New players

If you’re new to Games Workshop games you’ll be reassured
to know that finding other players is not normally a problem

- you’ll be surprised how many there are!
There may be a Games Workshop store near to you where
you can buy models, paint and games supplements. However
Games Workshop stores are not just shops, they are hobby
centres, where the staff will happily help you to learn the
rules, show you how to paint, and suggest ways to develop
your warband.

#### Warhammer players

If you already play Warhammer, the basic rules of Mordheim
will be familiar to you. Remember though, Warhammer is
designed for fighting battles between entire armies, whilst
Mordheim represents individual action between a dozen or so
warriors.
As a result, some of the rules developed for mass combat in
Warhammer do not apply to Mordheim, such as unit Break
tests and rank bonuses. On the other hand, there are new rules
for wounded warriors, climbing, parrying and other aspects
of individual combat.

#### What you will need

As well as this book, you will need the following items to
play Mordheim.

#### Citadel models

You will need enough miniatures of the appropriate race/type
to represent the warriors in your warband. It is a good idea to
work out your warband on paper first and then purchase the
miniatures that you require. Almost all possible weapon
variations can be added using the Mordheim equipment
spurs.
As you will see in the Warbands section, each warband fights
in a particular way – some are expert bowmen while others
are better in hand-to-hand combat. When choosing which
warband you want to lead you could choose one that reflects
your preferred playing style, or you could read the
background section and choose one that really captures your
imagination. A good way of picking a warband is simply to
pick the one with the models you like the best.

#### Playing surface

You will also need something to play your battles on. Any
firm, level surface is best, such as a tabletop or an area of
floor – most kitchen tables will do. It’s a good idea to use an
old sheet or blanket to protect the table from scratches. Some
players make a special gaming board from chipboard or other
similar material (divided into two or more pieces for ease of
storage) which they can use on top of a table to extend the
playing area. Whatever you use, you will find that a square
area approximately 4 x 4' is about right for most battles.

#### Terrain

The bitter struggles of a Mordheim battle take place in
labyrinthine streets, ruined buildings and on derelict
walkways. Pre-cut card and plastic scenery is available from
Games Workshop, but many gamers enjoy making their own.

```
As a rule, a table packed with scenery will lead to closer and
more exciting games.
Throughout the book you will find photographs, drawings
and descriptions of Mordheim. These should give you plenty
of ideas for producing your own scenery. Games Workshop’s
book ‘How to Make Wargames Terrain’ is also a good source
of ideas and practical hints on all asp
```
#### Counters

```
Counters can help you keep track of things on the tabletop.
You can always keep notes about who is hidden, carrying
treasure, etc, but counters are a convenient memory jogger
and speed the game up.
```
```
Hidden Counter Wyrdstone Counter
Above are some examples of counters you could photocopy
and stick onto thin card if you wish.
```
#### Dice

```
All dice rolls use a standard six-sided dice (usually shortened
to D6). Sometimes you will be asked to modify the result of
the dice roll. This is noted as D6 plus or minus a number,
such as D6+1 or D6-2. Roll the dice and add or subtract the
number indicated to get the final result. You may have to roll
a number of dice in one go. For example, 2D6 means roll two
dice and add the scores together. You may also come across
the term D3. As there is no such thing as a three-sided dice,
use the following method for determining a score between 1
and 3. Roll a D6 and halve the score, rounding up: 1 or 2
equals 1, 3 or 4 equals 2 and 5 or 6 equals 3. If you are given
the opportunity to re-roll a dice roll, you must accept the
second score, even if it’s worse than the original.
Artillery Dice: The Artillery Dice is one of the more
Specialise dice used in Games Workshop Games; the dice is
a standard six-sided dice but numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 & 10, and the
final side is marked with misfire. A standard six-sided dice
can be used in places of an Artillery Dice, just double the
face value of the dice, and a Six would count as the Misfire.
Scatter Dice: this is another more Specialise dice used in
Games Workshop Games; this is a standard six-sided dice
that has no numbers but has Arrows and a hit marker. A
standard six-sided dice can be used in places of a Scatter
Dice, clockwise, the top of the Dice = 1, right side = 2,
Bottom = 3, left side = 4 and a 5 or 6 means that the shot was
on target and did not move.
```
#### Tape measure

```
For measuring ranges you will need a tape measure marked
in inches, or a couple of plastic range rulers.
```
#### Other equipment

```
You will also need pens and paper to record details of your
warriors’ weapons and other details. You can use roster
sheets for this, and blank ones are included at the back of this
book. We recommend you photocopy them rather than use
the originals.

### Characteristics

In Mordheim the warriors each have different abilities, some
being better at certain actions, for example, fighting, shooting
or climbing, than they are at others. This variety in each
warrior is represented in the form of characteristics and
skills. Right now don’t worry about skills – these come later
with practice and battle experience. For now we just need to
consider a warrior’s characteristics.
Each model is defined by a set of characteristics: Movement,
Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Strength, Toughness, Wounds,
Initiative, Attacks and Leadership. Each characteristic is
assigned a value of (usually) between 1 and 10. The higher
the value your model has for any characteristic the better –
for example, a model with a Strength of 6 is stronger than a
model that has a Strength of 2.
MOVEMENT (M): A model’s Movement rate shows how
far the model can move in a turn, under normal conditions.
For example, a typical Human has a move of 4", while a
fleet-footed nimble Skaven has a move of 5".
WEAPON SKILL (WS): Weapon Skill is a measure of
close combat ability (i.e., how good the warrior is at hand-to-
hand fighting). A deadly swordsman or a crazed berserker
would have a high value compared to a lowly acolyte, for
example. The higher the WS, the more likely your warrior is
to hit his opponent.
BALLISTIC SKILL (BS): This shows how good a shot the
individual is. When you shoot a bow or fire a pistol, the
chance of hitting a target depends upon your model’s
Ballistic Skill. A normal Human has a BS of 3, though an
experienced marksman might have a BS of 4, 5 or even
higher.
STRENGTH (S): Strength indicates how strong a warrior is!
It is especially important for hand-to-hand combat, because
the stronger you are the harder you can hit. A Strength value
of 3 is about average.
TOUGHNESS (T): This is a measure of how easily an
individual can withstand a hit from a weapon or a blow from
a club or fist. The tougher you are, the harder you are to
wound or kill. An average Toughness value is 3, though a
gnarled old warrior might have a Toughness of 4!
WOUNDS (W): A model’s Wounds value shows how many
times the model can be wounded before it collapses, is killed
or incapacitated. Most individuals have only 1 Wound but
veteran warriors or large creatures such as Ogres might have
more.
INITIATIVE (I): The Initiative value indicates how fast and
nimble the warrior is. It determines the attacking order in
hand-to-hand combat, and is particularly important when the
model is climbing and moving amidst the ruins of Mordheim.
ATTACKS (A): The Attacks value indicates how many
blows the model can make in hand-to-hand combat. Most
warriors have an Attacks value of 1, but powerful fighters
may have more. The more Attacks you have, the greater the

```
chance you’ve got of beating your opponents into an
unrecognisable pulp!
LEADERSHIP (Ld): Leadership represents raw courage,
self control and charisma. The higher the model’s Leadership
value, the more likely he is to remain steadfast in combat
while others run off or are slain. For example, a cowardly
Skaven may have a Leadership of 5, while a cool, calm Elf
could have a Leadership of 8 or higher.
```
#### Zero level characteristics

```
Some creatures in Mordheim have been given a ‘0’ for
certain characteristics which means that they have no ability
in that field whatsoever. This usually applies to creatures
unable to use missile weapons (who would have a BS of 0)
but it might equally apply to other characteristics as well.
If a model has a WS of 0 then it cannot defend itself in hand-
to-hand combat, and any blows struck against it will
automatically hit.
```
#### Characteristic profiles

```
A model’s characteristic values are written in the form of a
chart called a characteristics profile (or just profile).
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Dieter Stahl 4 3 3 3 3 1 3 1 7
The example above is a typical profile for a Human warrior.
As you fight in more games against other players, your
warriors will get better and their characteristics may increase.
All these details are recorded using the Warband roster sheets
provided at the back of this book. This is explained properly
later on. For now it is enough to know what each
characteristic is for and how their values vary.
```
#### Characteristic tests

```
Often in the game a model will be required to take a test on
one of his own characteristics. In order to pass this test, the
model has to roll a D6 and obtain a result equal to or lower
than the value of the characteristic involved. Note that if you
roll a 6, you automatically fail the test regardless of the
model’s characteristic value.
For example: Dieter Stahl is jumping down from a wall that
is 3" high and has to take an Initiative test. He has an
Initiative value of 3 on his characteristic profile and therefore
will be successful if he rolls a 1, 2 or 3 on a D6. If he rolls a
4, 5 or 6 he will fail the test and fall down, suffering all the
painful consequences!
```
#### Leadership tests

```
Tests against the Leadership characteristic are done in a
slightly different way. In the case of a Leadership test, you
should roll two dice and add the two scores together. If the
result is equal to or less than the model’s Leadership
characteristic, the test has been passed.
For example: Dieter’s Leadership is 7, so to pass a
Leadership test he must roll 7 or less on 2D6.

### The Turn

In Mordheim you are in a charge of a warband and your
opponent is in charge of another.
The warriors and scenery in the game are set up on the
tabletop in a way that is appropriate for the encounter you are
fighting. Do not worry about this for now as these things will
be explained in full in the Scenarios section.
To play, one side takes a turn, then the other side, then the
original side and so on, much like in a game of draughts or
chess. When it is your turn, you may move all your models,
shoot with any warriors able to do so, and fight in hand-to-
hand combat. Once your turn is complete, it is your
opponent’s turn to move, shoot and fight.

#### Phases

To keep track of who is doing what and when, each turn is
split into four phases. This is called the Turn sequence.

Turn sequence
1 Recovery: During the recovery phase you may attempt to
rally individuals who have lost their nerve and recover
models that are knocked down or stunned.
2 Movement: During the movement phase you may move the
warriors of your warband according to the rules given in the
Movement section.

```
3 Shooting: In the shooting phase you may shoot with any
appropriate weapons as described in the rules for shooting.
4 Hand-to-hand combat: During the hand-to-hand combat
phase all models in hand-to-hand combat may fight. Note that
both sides fight in the hand-to-hand combat phase, regardless
of whose turn it is.
```
#### Recovery phase

```
During the recovery phase you may attempt to rally any of
your models who have lost their nerve (see the Recovery
Phase rules). To take a Rally test, roll 2D6. If the score is
equal to or less than the model’s Leadership value the model
stops fleeing and has rallied; turn it to face in any direction
you wish. The model cannot move or shoot for the rest of the
turn, but models able to do so can cast spells. If the test is
failed, the model will continue to flee towards the closest
table edge.
Note that a model cannot rally if the closest model to him is
an enemy model (fleeing, stunned, knocked down and hidden
models are not taken into consideration for this).
During the recovery phase, warriors in your warband who
have been stunned become knocked down instead and
warriors who have been knocked down may stand up (see the
Injuries section).

### Movement

During the movement phase models are moved in the
following order:

1. Charge!: If you want a model in your warband to charge
at an enemy model and attack it in hand-to-hand combat then
you must do this at the start of the movement phase before
moving any of your other models. When you charge a model,
declare to your opponent that you are doing so and indicate
which of his models it is attacking.
2. Compulsory Moves: Sometimes a model is forced to
move in a certain way and this is called a compulsory move.
For example, a fighter whose nerve breaks must run away
from his enemies and take cover.
Make all of your models’ compulsory moves before finishing
any remaining movement.
3. Remaining Moves: Once you have moved your chargers
and made any compulsory moves, you may move the rest of
your warriors as you see fit.

#### Moving

During their movement phase, models can move up to
movement rate their in any direction. They may move
(including running and charging) up and down ladders and
stairs, and over low obstacles such as barrels, boxes, etc.
In normal circumstances models don’t have to move their full
distance, or at all if you do not want them to. All exceptions
are explained later and invariably involve either charging or
compulsory moves.

#### Running

The normal Movement value of models represents a warrior
moving at a fairly rapid rate, but allows time for him to aim
and shoot a weapon and generally observe what is going on
around him. If you wish, a model may move much quicker
than this – he can run! A running warrior can move at double
speed (for example, 8" rather than 4"). Note that running is
not the same as charging as it does not allow your model to
engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat.
A model can only run if there are no enemy models within 8"
of it at the start of the turn (fleeing, stunned, knocked down
and hidden models do not count). Check this distance after
any charges have been declared. If there are any enemies
within 8" at the start of the turn, the model will prepare to
fight instead and so is unable to run. The running model can
move closer than 8" to an enemy as it moves.
Any model that runs loses its chance to shoot during that
turn. He is concentrating on running and is not prepared to
fight, having sheathed or shouldered his weapons. You
should declare that models are running as they move, as this
will remind both players that the model is unable to shoot
that turn. Running models can cast spells as normal.

#### Charge!

If you want a model to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand
combat then you must make a special move called a charge.
Without measuring the distance, declare that your model is
charging and indicate which enemy model he is going to
attack. You can charge any opposing model if you can draw
an unobstructed line from your model to the target. If your
warrior wants to charge an enemy model within 4" that he

```
can’t see (e.g., because it is behind a corner) but has not been
declared as hidden, he must pass an Initiative test to detect it.
If he fails the roll, your model may not charge this turn, but
may move his normal distance, shoot and cast spells.
A charge is like a running move, performed at double the
Movement rate, but ends with the attacker moving by the
most direct route into base-to-base contact with the enemy
model. Once their bases are touching they are engaged in
hand-to-hand combat. Models are also considered to be in
hand-to-hand combat even when separated by a low wall or
obstacle, where it is impossible for the bases to touch
physically because the obstacle is in the way.
```
```
If an unengaged (i.e., not in hand-to-hand combat) enemy
model lies within 2" of the charge route, that model may
choose to intercept the charger if he wishes. This
‘interception area’ is shown in the diagram above. Only one
enemy model may attempt to intercept each charger. If the
intercepting warrior would normally require a Fear test to
engage the charger then he must pass one in order to be
allowed to intercept. Failure means he will not move. If the
intercepting warrior causes fear then move the models into
contact and then take a Fear test for the original charger
(assuming he would normally do so) as if he was the one
being charged. Regardless of the results of this test it is still
the original charger who counts as charging in the subsequent
round of combat, not the intercepting warrior.
Sometimes a charging warrior may not reach the enemy
because you have miscalculated the distance. If this happens
move your warrior his normal move distance towards the
enemy. This is called a failed charge. The model cannot shoot
in the same turn in which he failed a charge, but he can cast
spells as normal.
Models cannot be moved into hand-to-hand combat except by
charging – any move that brings a warrior into hand-to-hand
```

combat is a charge by definition. A model that charges will
‘strike first’ in the first round of the ensuing combat.

#### Charging more than one opponent

If you can move your warrior into base contact with more
than one enemy model with its charge move, it can charge
them both. This might be inadvisable as it’ll then be fighting
two enemies at once!

#### Hiding

The Hiding rule represents warriors concealing themselves in
a way that our unmoving and dramatically posed models
cannot. A hiding warrior keeps as still as possible, just
peeking out of cover.
A model can hide if he ends his move behind a low wall, a
column or in a similar position where he could reasonably
conceal himself. The player must declare that the warrior is
hiding and place a Hidden counter beside the model for it to
count as being hidden.
A model that runs, flees, is stunned or charges cannot hide
that turn. His sudden burst of speed does not give him time to
hide.
A model may stay hidden over several turns, so long as he
stays behind a wall or similar feature. He may even move
around so long as he stays hidden while doing so. If an
enemy moves so that he can see the hidden warrior, the
model is no longer hidden and the counter is removed. When
hidden, a warrior cannot be seen, shot at or charged.
While hiding, a model cannot shoot or cast spells without
giving away its position. If a hidden model shoots, or moves
so that he can be seen, he is no longer hidden and can be shot
at as normal.
A model may not hide if he is too close to an enemy model –
he will be seen or heard no matter how well concealed.
Enemy warriors will always see, hear or otherwise detect
hidden foes within their Initiative value in inches. So a
warrior whose Initiative value is 3 will automatically spot all
hidden enemies within 3".

#### Terrain

The ruined city of Mordheim is a dark and dangerous place,
where tumbled down towers and blasted houses form a vast
maze of streets and alleyways.
OPEN GROUND: The tabletop surface, floors of buildings,
connecting overhangs, ladders and ropes are all considered to
be open ground and will not affect movement even if the
model is charging. It can also go through doors and hatches
without slowing down.
DIFFICULT GROUND: Difficult ground includes steep or
treacherous slopes, bushes and the angled roofs of buildings.
Models move at half speed over difficult terrain.
VERY DIFFICULT GROUND: This is really dangerous
terrain, such as narrow crawl holes through the rubble.
Models may move at a quarter rate, so if the model moves 4"
over open ground it can only move 1" over very difficult
ground.
WALLS AND BARRIERS: Walls, hedges and other low
obstacles form barriers that you can either go around or leap
over. A model can leap over a barrier that is less than 1" high.
This does not affect its movement in any way.

#### Climbing

```
Often the ruined buildings of Mordheim do not have stairs or
ladders, so your warriors will have to climb to reach the
upper floors of buildings.
Any model (except animals!) can climb up or down fences,
walls, etc. He must be touching what he wants to climb at the
start of his movement phase. He may climb up to his total
Movement in a single movement phase (but cannot run while
he is climbing). Any remaining movement can be used as
normal. If the height is more than the model’s normal move,
he cannot climb the wall.
To climb, a model must take an Initiative test. If he fails it
whilst climbing up, he cannot move that turn. If he fails it
while climbing down, he falls from where he started his
descent (see the Falling section).
```
#### Jumping down

```
Your warrior may jump down from high places (up to a
maximum height of 6") such as walkways and balconies at
any time during his movement phase. Take an Initiative test
for every full 2" he jumps down. If he fails any of the tests,
the model falls from the point where he jumped, takes
damage (see Falling) and may not move any more during the
movement phase. If successful, the model can continue his
movement as normal (jumping down does not use up any of
the model’s Movement allowance).
```
#### Diving charge

```
You may charge any enemy troops that are below a balcony
or overhang, etc, that your model is on. If an enemy model is
within 2" of the place where your warrior lands, he may make
a diving charge against it. Take an Initiative test for each full
2" of height your model jumped down from, up to a
maximum of 6", like a normal jump. If he fails any of them,
your model has fallen and suffers damage, may not move any
more during the movement phase and cannot charge the
enemy. If he succeeds, the model gains a +1 Strength bonus
and +1 to hit bonus but only during the following hand-to-
hand combat phase.
```
#### Jumping over gaps

```
Models may jump over gaps (up to a maximum of 3") and
streets, (e.g., from the roof of a building to another). Deduct
the distance jumped from the model’s movement but
remember that you cannot measure the distance before
jumping. If your model does not have enough movement to
jump the distance, he automatically falls. If your model is
able to cover the distance, he must pass an Initiative test or
fall. A model may jump over a gap and still fire a missile
weapon if it is not running. It may also jump as part of its
charge or running move.

#### Warriors knocked down or stunned

If a warrior is knocked down or stunned (see the Shooting
section for details) within 1" of the edge of a roof or building,
there is a chance that it will slip and fall off. Take an
Initiative test. If the test is failed, the model falls over the
edge to the ground and takes damage as detailed below.

#### Falling

A model that falls takes D3 hits at a Strength equal to the
height in inches that it fell (e.g., if the model fell 4", it would
take D3 hits at Strength 4). No armour saves apply. Falling
will not cause critical hits (see the Hand-to-Hand Combat
section for the Critical Hits rules). A model that falls may not
move any further or hide during that turn, even if it is not
hurt.

#### Swimming

```
Players should establish which way the river is flowing at the
start of the game. To represent how models interact with
water these basic rules apply:
```
1. All rivers count as difficult (or worse) terrain for all
    models except those considered as aquatic.
2. Models swimming with the current will double their
    base move.
3. Models swimming against the current of a slow
    moving river may only move a quarter of their base
    move, but you may not swim against the current of a
    fast moving river.
4. Aquatic models suffer no reduction of their base move
    when swimming against the current of a slow moving
    river but may not swim against the current of a fast
    moving river.
5. Models wearing armour may not attempt to move
    through any water deeper than shallow. Shields and
    bucklers do not count for this as they are assumed to
    be strapped on the backs.
Aquatic models in water, either swamp, streams or rivers can
elect to be Hidden at the discretion of the player. Models
cannot move upstream in fast moving rivers without floating
transportation, such as a boat or canoe.


### Shooting

Warriors that fight in the ruins of Mordheim are usually
armed to the teeth! Individual warriors often have several
different weapons such as swords, knives, bows and even
blackpowder weapons.
During your warband’s shooting phase each of your warriors
may shoot once with one of his weapons. This means that he
can fire a bow, shoot with a crossbow, or hurl a throwing
knife, for example.
Work through the models one at a time. Pick which fighter is
going to shoot, nominate his target, work out whether he hits
the enemy and, if he does, any wounds or injuries that are
caused. Then continue with the next shooter. You can take
shots in any order you wish. Be sure to remember or note
down which models have already shot.

#### Who can shoot

Each model can shoot once in the shooting phase, so long as
he can see a target and assuming he has a suitable weapon.
He may not fire in the following circumstances: if he is
engaged in hand-to-hand combat, has run or failed a charge in
the movement phase, has rallied this turn or is stunned or
knocked down.
To shoot at a target, a model must be able to see it, and the
only way to check this is to stoop over the tabletop for a
model’s eye view. Models can see all around themselves (i.e.,
360°), and they may be turned freely to face in any direction
before firing. Note that turning on the spot does not count as
moving.

#### Closest target

You must shoot at the closest enemy, as he represents the
most immediate threat and therefore the most obvious target.
However, you may shoot at a more distant target if it is easier
to hit or if closer models are stunned or knocked down (see
diagram on next page). For example, a closer target may be
hard to hit because it is in cover, whilst a more distant target
might be in the open and therefore an easier shot. You may
always choose to shoot at a Large Target if you can see it,
whether it is in cover or not and even if it is not the closest
target.
You can shoot at models that are fleeing, knocked down or
stunned, but you can choose to ignore them, because they do
not represent an immediate threat. It is better to shoot the
closest standing enemy model instead.
Note that you may not shoot at models that are engaged in
hand-to-hand combat, as the risk of hitting your comrades is
too great.

#### Cover

The many walls, ruined buildings and other masonry in
Mordheim offer plenty of cover. If any portion of the target is
hidden by a piece of scenery or another model, the shooting
model will suffer a penalty as explained below.

```
Sometimes it will be obvious whether a target can be seen; at
other times it will be more difficult, as buildings and other
scenery are in the way. If the shooter can see only part of the
target’s body, the target is in cover and the shooter suffers a -
1 penalty on his To Hit roll.
If a shot misses its target by 1, and that target claimed the -
modifier for cover, then the shot strikes the cover instead.
Normally this doesn’t matter, but in the case where a model
is concealed behind another warrior, or when the cover is a
powder keg, it might be extremely important!
```

#### Shooting from an elevated position

```
A model situated in an elevated position (i.e., anything that is
more than 2" above the table surface, such as an upper floor
of a building), may freely pick any target he can see and
shoot at it. The exception to this rule is that if there are
enemies in the same building and in line of sight of the
shooter, he must shoot at these, as they present a more
immediate threat.
```
#### Range

```
Once you have decided to shoot and have chosen a target you
must measure to see whether the shot is within range. Each
type of missile weapon has a maximum range, as described in
the Weapons & Armour section of the book.
Assuming that your target is within range your warrior can
proceed with the shot. If the target is out of range then he has
automatically missed this turn.
```
#### Hitting the target

```
To determine whether a shot hits its target, roll a D6. The
dice score needed will depend upon how good a shot the
shooter is (as indicated by his Ballistic Skill). The chart
below shows the minimum D6 roll needed to score a hit.
BS of shooter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
D6 roll needed 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -
```
#### Hit modifiers

It is easier to hit a target that is in the open compared to a
target behind cover. Usually it is also easier to hit a target if it
is close compared to one further away. These situations are
represented by the following modifiers:
HIT MODIFIERS
-1 Cover: If any part of the model is obscured by scenery or
other models then it counts as being in cover.
-1 Long range: If you are shooting at a target that is more
than half of your weapon’s maximum range away.
-1 Moving: If your model has moved at all shooting (other
than standing up, or turning to face your target) during this
turn.

```
+1 Large Target: If either the target model has the Large
Target special rule (such as an Ogre), or whose main ‘body’
is over 2" tall or wide (such as most buildings).
```
#### Roll to Wound

```
Once you have hit a target test to see if a wound is inflicted.
A shot may fail to cause a wound because it hits part of the
target’s equipment, just scratches the skin or causes some
very minor injury which the warrior bravely (or stupidly)
ignores. If you fail to cause a wound, the target is unharmed.
To determine whether your shot has caused a wound,
compare the Strength of the weapon with the Toughness of
the target. You will find a complete description of the various
```
Assembled By Paul H Page 9 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


weapons together with their Strength values and special rules
in the Weapons & Armour section.
The chart above shows the D6 score required to turn a hit into
a wound Note that a dash (–) means that there is no chance of
wounding the target.
Deploying your archers in the upper floors of buildings is a
good idea. They will be in cover and can freely pick their
targets.

#### Critical Hits

If you roll a 6 when rolling to wound (for hand-to-hand
combat and shooting only) you will cause a critical hit. Roll a
D6 and consult the Critical Hit chart below to determine the
damage caused by the critical hit. You should also roll to see
whether the target makes its armour save or suffers damage
as normal.
In addition, if the attacker normally needs 6s to wound his
target, he cannot cause a critical hit. His opponent is simply
too tough to suffer a serious injury at the hands of such a
puny creature!
Each warrior may only cause one critical hit in each hand-to-
hand combat phase (see the Close Combat section), so if he
has several attacks, the first 6 you roll to wound will cause a
critical hit.
CRITICAL HIT CHART
1-2 Hits a vital part. The wound is doubled to 2 wounds.
Roll any armour saves before doubling the wound.
3-4 Hits an exposed spot. The wound is doubled to 2
wounds. The attack ignores all armour saves.
5-6 Master strike! The wound is doubled to 2 wounds. The
attack ignores all armour saves. You gain +2 to any Injury
rolls.
If a critical hit causes more than 1 wound, and the weapon the
attacking model is using normally causes several wounds,
then use the one that causes the most damage.

#### Armour

Steel breastplates, chainmail, leather tunics, shields... all
these and more are readily available in the forges of the
villages surrounding Mordheim. That is if you are prepared to
pay the price, since armour is very expensive.
If a warrior wearing armour suffers a wound roll a D6. If the
dice roll is sufficiently high the wounding hit has bounced off
the armour and has not hurt the wearer at all. The dice score
required varies according to the type of armour.
The table below summarises the most common armour types
and the D6 rolls required to make a save. Note that carrying a
shield increases the save by +1. For example, a warrior in
light armour with a shield will save on a roll of a 5 or 6. A
warrior who has a shield but no armour will save on a roll of
a 6.
Minimum D6 score Armour required to save
Light armour 6
Heavy armour 5
Gromril armour 4
Shield adds +1 to the armour save

#### Armour save modifiers

Some weapons are better at penetrating armour than others. A
shot from a short bow can be deflected relatively easily, but a
shot from a crossbow penetrates armour much more
effectively.

```
The higher a weapon’s Strength, the more easily it can pierce
armour. The chart below shows the reduction to the enemy’s
armour saving throw for different Strength weapons.
Strength Save modifier
1-3 None
4 -
5 -
6 -
7 -
8 -
9+ -
Some weapons are better at penetrating armour than their
Strength value suggests (Elven bows, for example). This is
covered in the entry for each particular weapon (see the
Weapons & Armour section).
Example: Dieter wears heavy armour and carries a shield.
His armour save is 4+. He is hit by a crossbow (Strength 4)
and therefore he will save on a D6 roll of 5+ (i.e., 4+–
1=5+).
```
#### Injuries

```
Most warriors have a Wounds characteristic of 1, but some
have a value of 2 or more. If the target has more than 1
wound then deduct 1 from his total each time he suffers a
wound. Make a note on the roster sheet. So long as the model
has at least 1 wound remaining he may continue to fight.
As soon as a fighter’s Wounds are reduced to zero, roll to
determine the extent of his injuries. The player who inflicted
the wound rolls a D6 for the wound that reduced the model to
zero wounds and for every wound the model receives after
that. If a model suffers several wounds in one turn, roll once
for each of them and apply the highest result.
1-2 Knocked down: The force of the blow knocks the
warrior down. Place the model face up to show that he
has been knocked down.
3-4 Stunned: The target falls to the ground where he lies
wounded and barely conscious. Turn the model face
down to show that he has been stunned.
5-6 Out of action: The target has been badly hurt and falls
to the ground unconscious. He takes no further part in
the game and is immediately removed from the battle.
```
#### Knocked down

```
A fighter who has been knocked down falls to the ground
either because of a jarring blow he has sustained, because he
has slipped, or because he has thrown himself to the ground
to avoid injury. Turn the model face up to show that he has
been knocked down. Knocked down models may crawl 2"
during the movement phase, but may not fight in hand-to-
hand combat, shoot or cast spells. If he is in base-to-base
contact with an enemy, a knocked down model can crawl 2"
away only if the enemy is engaged in hand-to-hand combat
with another opponent, otherwise he has to stay where he is.
In combat he cannot strike back and the enemy will have a
good chance of putting him out of action (see the Warriors
Knocked Down section of the Close Combat rules on page
13).
A warrior who has been knocked down may stand up at the
start of his next turn. In that turn he may move at half rate,
shoot and cast spells, he cannot charge or run. If he is
engaged in hand-to-hand combat, he may not move away and
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 10 Assembled by Paul H


Assembled By Paul H Page 11 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)

will automatically strike last, irrespective of weapons or
Initiative. After this turn the fighter moves and fights
normally, even though he has zero wounds left. If the model
takes any further wounds, then roll for injury once more,
exactly as if the model had just sustained its last wound.

#### Stunned

When a warrior is stunned, he is either badly injured or
temporarily knocked out. Turn the model face down to show
that he has been stunned. A fighter who is stunned may do
nothing at all. A player may turn the model face up in the

```
next recovery phase, and the warrior is then treated as
knocked down.
```
#### Out of action

```
A warrior who is out of action is also out of the game.
Remove the model from the tabletop. It’s impossible to tell at
this point whether the warrior is alive or dead, but for game
purposes it makes no difference at this stage. After the battle
you can test to see whether he survives and if he sustains any
serious lasting injuries as a result of his wounds (see page
170 for details).
```
### Close Combat

#### Who can fight

Models whose bases are touching are engaged in hand-to-
hand combat. This can only happen once a warrior has
charged his enemy, as models are otherwise not allowed to
move into contact.
All close quarter fighting is worked out in the hand-to-hand
combat phase. Regardless of whose turn it is, all models in
hand-to-hand combat will fight. A warrior can fight against
enemies to his side, front, or rear. In reality the fighters are
constantly moving, dodging, and weaving as they struggle to
kill their adversaries.
Models fighting in hand-to-hand combat do not shoot in the
shooting phase. They are far too busy fighting for their lives.
Any very close range shots they are able to make using
pistols are treated like close combat weapon attacks (see the
Weapons & Armour section).

#### Who strikes first

Normally, models fight in order of descending Initiative with
the highest striking first. If their Initiatives are equal, roll a
dice to see who strikes first. If a model stood up in the
Recovery phase of that turn, then he will strike last
irrespective of any other circumstances.
Sometimes a model will be allowed to ‘strike first’ for some
reason. Most commonly this is because they charged in that
turn, but some equipment, skills and spells produce the same
effect. If only one model ‘strikes first’ then it does so and the
remainder of the combatants strike in Initiative order as
described above.
If there are several models who are each entitled to ‘strike
first’, then they determine the order of combat between
themselves by Initiative, as described above. Once all those
that were eligible to ‘strike first’ have fought, any other
combatants fight in Initiative order.
which models fight
A model can fight if its base is touching the base of an enemy
model. Even models attacked from the side or rear can fight.
If a warrior is touching more than one enemy, he can choose
which to attack. If he has more than 1 Attack, he can divide
them in any way the player wishes, so long as he makes this
clear before rolling to hit.

#### Hitting the enemy

```
To determine whether hits are scored, roll a D6 for each
model fighting. If a model has more than 1 Attack roll a D
for each attack.
The dice roll needed to score a hit on your enemy depends
upon the Weapon Skills of the attacker and the foe. Compare
the Weapon Skill of the attacker with that of his opponent
and consult the To Hit chart below to find the minimum D
score needed to hit.
fighting with two weapons
Some maniac warriors carry two weapons, one in each hand,
so they can rain a flurry of blows on their enemies. A warrior
armed with two one-handed weapons may make 1 extra
Attack with the additional weapon. Note that this is added to
the total of the warrior’s attacks after other modifiers, such as
frenzy, have been applied. If he is armed with two different
weapons (sword and dagger, for example), he will make a
single attack with whichever weapon he chooses, and all
others with the remaining weapon. Roll to hit and wound for
each weapon separately.
```
#### Weapon modifiers

```
Unlike hits from shooting, the Strength of the attacker is used
to determine wounds, rather than that of the weapon itself.
However, some weapons confer a bonus on the attacker’s
Strength (see the Weapons & Armour section for full details).
```
#### Roll to wound

```
Once your model has hit a target you must test to see whether
a wound is inflicted. Sometimes a strike may fail to wound
simply because it causes an insignificant injury or glances off
the enemy’s equipment.
To determine whether the blow has caused a wound compare
the Strength of the weapon with the Toughness of the target.
You will find a complete description of the various weapons
together with their Strength values and special rules in the
Weapons & Armour section.
Follow the same procedure for wounding and causing critical
hits as in the Shooting section. Note that a dash (–) means
that there is no chance of wounding the target.
```

#### Armour

Combatants that are wounded have the chance to avoid
damage if they are wearing armour or carrying shields. This
is exactly the same as described for shooting, and the same
rules apply.
For each wound suffered the player rolls a D6. If he rolls
greater than or equal to the armour save of his fighter then
that wound has been absorbed or deflected by the armour.

#### Armour save modifiers

Some models are so powerful that armour provides less
protection against them.
The higher a creature’s Strength the more easily it can pierce
armour. The following chart shows the reduction in the

```
enemy’s armour saving throw caused by the attacker’s
Strength.
Strength Save modifier
1-3 None
4 -
5 -
6 -
7 -
8 -
9+ -
Some weapons also confer a bonus to the user’s Strength,
making it more likely that any hits will pierce the opponent’s
armour. These bonuses are given in the Weapons & Armour
section.
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 12 Assembled by Paul H


#### Parry

Bucklers are small shields which offer no increase to the
armour saving throw, but allow you to parry attacks. Swords
are also used to parry enemy attacks.
When an opponent scores a hit, warriors equipped with
bucklers or swords may try to parry the blow.
Roll a D6. If the score is higher than the number your
opponent rolled to hit, the buckler or sword has parried the
strike. Note that it is therefore impossible to parry a blow
which scored a 6 on the roll to hit.
A buckler or sword may only parry one blow per hand-to-
hand combat phase. A parried blow is ignored and has no
effect. If your opponent scored several hits, you will have to
try to beat the highest score (if the highest score is a 6, you
automatically lose the chance of parrying that opponent’s
attacks). If a model is fighting against several opponents, it
may only parry the strike from the enemy who makes the first
hit(s) (i.e., the attacking model with the highest Initiative). In
the case of equal Initiative characteristics roll a dice to decide
who strikes first.
If your model is armed with a buckler and a sword, you may
re-roll any failed parries once. A model armed with two
swords can still only roll once, but may add +1 to the results.
A model may not parry attacks made with twice (or more) his
own basic Strength – they are simply too powerful to be
stopped.

#### Warriors knocked down

If an enemy is fighting a warrior who is knocked down, he
may attack him to put him out of his misery. All attacks
against a warrior who is knocked down hit automatically. If
any of the attacks wound the knocked down model and he
fails his armour save, he is automatically taken out of action
as explained previously. A knocked down model may not
parry.

#### Warriors stunned

```
A stunned warrior is at the mercy of his enemies. A stunned
model is automatically taken out of action if an enemy can
attack him in hand-to-hand combat.
```
#### Attacking stunned and knocked down

#### warriors

```
Note that a model with multiple attacks may not stun / knock
down and then automatically take a warrior out of action
during the same hand-to-hand combat phase. The only way
you can achieve this is to have more than one of your models
attacking the same enemy. So, if the enemy is stunned /
knocked down by the first warrior, he can be hit and put out of
action by the next warrior to attack.
If your model is engaged in close combat with an enemy who
is still standing, he cannot attack any other models that are
stunned or knocked down, since in reality they will not pose
an immediate threat to him and their companions will try to
protect them.
```
#### Moving from combat

```
Once models are engaged in hand-to-hand combat they
cannot move away during their movement phase. They must
fight until they are either taken out of action, until they take
out their enemies, or until one or the other breaks and runs.
The exception to this rule is that if all a model’s close combat
opponents are knocked down or stunned, he may move away
from the combat if you wish, and even charge other enemies
within range.
```
#### Breaking from combat

```
A warrior who panics whilst fighting in hand-to-hand combat
will break off and make a run for it as described in the
Leadership & Psychology section.
When a fighter breaks from combat he simply turns and runs
off. His opponents automatically hit the warrior as he breaks,
each inflicting 1 hit which is worked out immediately.
Note that warriors cannot choose to leave a fight voluntarily.
```
Assembled By Paul H Page 13 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


### Leadership & psychology

#### The rout test

A player must make a Rout test at the start of his turn if a
quarter (25%) or more of his warband is out of action. For
example, in a warband that has twelve warriors a test is
needed if three or more are out of action. Even warbands who
are normally immune to psychology (such as Undead) must
make Rout tests.
If the Rout test is failed, the warband automatically loses the
fight. The game ends immediately and surviving warriors
retreat from the area. A failed Rout test is the most common
way in which a fight ends.
To take a Rout test roll 2D6. If the score is equal to or less
than the warband leader’s Leadership, the player has passed
the test and may continue to fight.
If the warband’s leader is out of action or stunned, then the
player may not use his Leadership to take the test. Instead,
use the highest Leadership characteristic amongst any
remaining fighters who are not stunned or out of action.

#### Voluntary rout

A player may choose to voluntarily Rout at the start of any of
his own turns if he wishes, but only if he was already
required to take a Rout test or if a quarter (25%) or more of
his warband are out of action.

#### Leaders

A warrior within 6" of his leader may use his leader’s
Leadership value when taking Leadership tests. This
represents the leader’s ability to encourage his warriors and
push them beyond normal limits.
A leader cannot confer this bonus if he is knocked down,
stunned or fleeing himself. The sight of your leader running
for cover is obviously far from encouraging!

#### All alone

Being outnumbered and alone is a nerve-racking situation for
any warrior.
If your warrior is fighting alone against two or more
opponents, and there are no friendly models within 6"
(knocked down, stunned or fleeing friends do not count), he
must make a test at the end of his combat phase. The test is
taken against the model’s Leadership on 2D6. If the warrior
scores equal to or under his Leadership his nerve holds. If the
score is greater than his Leadership, the warrior breaks from
combat and runs. Each one of his opponents may make one
automatic hit against him as he turns to run. If the model
survives, he runs 2D6" directly away from his enemies.
At the start of each of his turns, the warrior must take another
Leadership test. If he passes, he stops but can do nothing else
during his own turn except cast spells. If he fails or is
charged, he runs 2D6" towards the nearest table edge,
avoiding any enemy models. If he reaches the table edge
before he has managed to recover his nerves, he is removed
from combat.
If a warrior is charged while he is fleeing, the charger is
moved into base contact as normal, but the fleeing warrior
will then run a further 2D6" towards the table edge, before
any blows can be struck.

#### Fear

```
Fear is a natural reaction to huge or unnerving creatures. A
model must take a Fear test (i.e., test against his Leadership)
in the following situations. Note that creatures that cause fear
can ignore these tests.
a) If the model is charged by a warrior or a creature
which causes fear.
If a warrior is charged by an enemy that he fears then he must
take a test to overcome that fear. Test when the charge is
declared and is determined to be within range. If the test is
passed the model may fight as normal. If it is failed, the
model must roll 6s to score hits in that round of combat.
b) If the model wishes to charge a fear causing enemy.
If a warrior wishes to charge an enemy that it fears then it
must take a test to overcome this. If it fails the model may not
charge and must remain stationary for the turn. Treat this as a
failed charge.
```
#### Frenzy

```
Some warriors can work themselves into a berserk state of
fury, a whirlwind of destruction in which all concern for their
own personal safety is ignored in favour of mindless
violence. These warriors are described as being frenzied.
Frenzied models must always charge if there are any enemy
models within charge range (check after charges have been
declared). The player has no choice in this matter – the
warrior will automatically declare a charge.
Frenzied warriors fight with double their Attacks
characteristic in hand-to-hand combat. Warriors with 1
Attack therefore have 2 Attacks, warriors with 2 Attacks have
4, etc. If a warrior is carrying a weapon in each hand, he
receives +1 Attack for this as normal. This extra Attack is not
doubled.
Once they are within charge range, frenzied warriors are
immune to all other psychology, such as fear and don’t have
to take these tests as long as they remain within charge range.
If a frenzied model is knocked down or stunned, he is no
longer frenzied. He continues to fight as normal for the rest of
the battle.
```
#### Hatred

```
Hatred is a very powerful emotion, and during this era of
strife and war, bitter rivalry is commonplace.
Warriors who fight enemies they hate in hand-to-hand
combat may re-roll any misses when they attack in the first
turn of each hand-to-hand combat. This bonus applies only in
the first turn of each combat and represents the warrior
venting his pent-up hatred on his foe. After the initial round
of hand-to-hand combat he loses some impetus and
subsequently fights as normal for the rest of the combat.
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 14 Assembled by Paul H


#### Stupidity

Many large and powerful creatures, as well as some of the
more unhinged individuals in Mordheim, are unfortunately
rather stupid.
Models that are stupid test at the start of their turn to see if
they overcome their stupidity. Make a test for each model
affected by stupidity. If you pass the test by rolling their
Leadership value or less on 2D6 then all is well – the
creatures behave reasonably intelligently and the player may
move and fight with them as normal.
If the test is failed all is not well. Until the start of his next
turn (when it takes a new Stupidity test) the model will not
cast spells or fight in hand-to-hand combat (though his
opponent will still have to roll to hit him as normal).

```
If a model who fails a Stupidity test is not in hand-to-hand
combat, roll a D6.
1-3 The warrior moves directly forward at half speed in a
shambling manner. He will not charge an enemy (stop his
movement 1" away from any enemy he would have come
into contact with). He can fall down from the edge of a sheer
drop (see the Falling rules) or hit an obstacle, in which case
he stops. The model will not shoot this turn.
4-6 The warrior stands inactive and drools a bit during this
turn. He may do nothing else, as drooling is so demanding.
Regardless of whether the test is passed or failed, the result
applies until the start of the model’s following turn (when it
takes a new Stupidity test).
```
### Alignment

With so many warbands roaming in Mordheim and its
surrounding landscape and many of them having different
alignment, some warbands are Lawful while others are
Chaotic and then you have those that are Neutral. The
Alignment of a warband will help in many ways, like which
Hired Swords you can hire, the cost of hiring and upkeep of
Hired Swords, the maximum size of your Warband and other
bonuses. The Player must choose an alignment when they are
building a warband. Some warbands can only have one
alignment choice (i.e. all Witch Hunters warbands are always
Lawful).

#### Multi-player Games

In some Campaigns and Scenarios warbands may ally
themselves with other warbands, by doing this trust becomes
a problem, like Lawful warbands will not work alongside
Chaotic warbands, but both will work alongside a Neutral
warbands, this would be a distrusted alliance,

##### Distrusted Alliance

A Distrusted Alliance may form in many ways; the first is by
a Neutral warband allied with a Lawful or Chaotic warband,
the second is between races of the Dwarves and Elves, and
the third is between warbands that hate each other for some
reason.
If two distrusted alliance model are within 6” of each other
then both models have a -1 leadership penalty. They also stop
each other from running.

#### Bonuses

##### Lawful

```
The warbands that are Lawful aligned with other Lawful
warbands as well as Lawful / Neutral and Neutral warbands.
Hate all chaotic warbands. Lawful warbands get D3 rerolls
per battle; the rerolls can be uses in the Exploration Phase if
not used in battle. All Neutral / Chaotic warbands will count
as being Chaotic in the eyes of Lawful warbands.
```
##### Lawful / Neutral

```
The warbands that are Lawful / Neutral aligned with other
Lawful / Neutral warbands as well as Lawful and Neutral
warbands. Lawful / Neutral warbands get 1 reroll per battle;
the reroll can be uses in the Exploration Phase if not used in
battle.
```
##### Neutral

```
The warbands that are Neutral aligned with any other
warbands including Lawful and Chaotic warbands.
```
##### Neutral / Chaotic

```
The warbands that are Neutral / Chaotic aligned with other
Neutral / Chaotic warbands as well as Neutral and Chaotic
warbands. Any member of a Neutral / Chaotic warband
which is afflicted by a mutation may still stay on the roster
even if normally he would have to leave. Neutral / Chaotic
warbands get 1 reroll per battle; the reroll can be uses in the
Exploration Phase if not used in battle.
```
##### Chaotic

```
The warbands that are Chaotic aligned with other Chaotic
warbands as well as Neutral and Neutral / Chaotic warbands.
Any member of a chaotic warband which is afflicted by a
mutation may still stay on the roster even if normally he
would have to leave. Chaotic warbands get D3 rerolls per
battle; the rerolls can be uses in the Exploration Phase if not
used in battle. All Lawful / Neutral warbands will count as

### Weapons & Armour

Life and death in Mordheim is decided by the quantity and quality of the weapons a warrior carries. This section describes
the different weapons and other equipment such as armour and shields.

#### Close Combat Weapons

##### Axe

The axe is the traditional weapon of Empire woodsmen, and is also
used as a weapon in poorer rural areas. Axes have a heavy blade
and, if swung by a strong man, can cause a lot of damage. The blade
of an axe can easily cut through armour, though it requires
considerable strength from the wielder. Of all the warriors in the
Old World, Dwarfs are the most adept at making axes. Their axes
are invaluable to the warriors of the Old World and are some of the
most sought after weapons.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Cutting Edge
Special Rules
Cutting Edge: An axe has an extra save modifier of -1, so a
model with Strength 4 using an axe has a -2 save modifier
when he hits an opponent in hand-to-hand combat.

##### Ball and Chain

This is a huge iron ball with a chain attached, used by the dreaded
Night Goblin Fanatics to deal out whirling death. Enormously
heavy, it can only be used when combined with Mad Cap
Mushrooms.
[Goblins Only]
Range: Close combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Two Handed, Incredible Force,
Cumbersome, Unwieldy, Random,

Special Rules
Two Handed: A model armed with a Ball and Chain may
not use a shield, buckler or additional weapon in close
combat. If the model is equipped with a shield he will still get
a +1 bonus to his armour save against shooting
Incredible Force: Because the Ball and Chain is so heavy,
normal armour does very little to protect against it. No
armour saves are allowed against wounds caused by a Ball
and Chain. In addition, any hit from a Ball and Chain is very
likely to take off someone’s head (or at least break some
ribs!). Therefore, any hit that successfully wounds will do
1D3 wounds instead of 1.
Cumbersome: Because the Ball and Chain is so heavy, a
model equipped with one may carry no other weapons or
equipment. In addition, only a model under the influence of
Mad Cap Mushrooms has the strength to wield a ball and
chain.

```
Unwieldy: The great weight of the Ball and Chain can easily
tear ligaments or pull a wielder’s arms out of their sockets.
While someone under the influence of Mad Cap Mushrooms
will not notice such effects, when the drug wears off he will
be in great pain. To represent this, at the end of the battle the
controlling player must roll for Injury for each model that
used a Ball and Chain, just as if the model had been taken
Out Of Action. If the model was actually taken Out Of
Action normally, just roll once for Injury – there is no need to
make a second roll.
Random: The only way to wield a Ball and Chain is to swing
it around in large circles, using your body as a counter-
weight. Unfortunately this is not a very controllable fighting
style, and as soon as he starts swinging his Ball and Chain, a
warrior starts to lose control. The first turn he starts swinging
the Ball and Chain, the model is moved 2D6" in a direction
nominated by the controlling player. In his subsequent
Movement phases, roll a D6 to determine what the model
does:
D6 Effect
1 The model trips and strangles himself with the chain.
The model is taken Out Of Action. When rolling for
Injury after the game, a roll of 1-3 means the model is
out permanently, instead of the normal 1-2.
2-5 The model moves 2D6" in a direction nominated by
the controlling player.
6 The model moves 2D6" in a random direction. If the
player owns a Scatter dice (available from Games
Workshop stores), roll that to determine direction. If
not, then roll a D6: 1 – Straight Forward, 2-3 – Right,
4-5 – Left, 6 – Straight Back
```
##### Barbed Spear

```
The favoured spear of the hobgoblin warriors is equipped with
gruesome rear-facing barbs, which rend and tear their opponents as
the spear is withdrawn after the attack.
[Hobgoblin Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Strike First, Unwieldy, Cavalry Bonus, +
To Wound
Special Rules
Strike First: A warrior with a spear strikes first in the first
turn of hand-to-hand combat.
Unwieldy: A warrior with a spear may only use a shield or a
buckler in his other hand. He may not use a second weapon.
Cavalry Bonus: If using the rules for mounted models, a
mounted warrior armed with a spear receives a +1 Strength
bonus when he charges. This bonus only applies for that turn.
+1 To Wound: Because of the bards on the spear the user
gets a +1 To Wound.
```

##### Beastlash

The Beastmaster make good use of their whips to goad their hounds
and creatures into combat.
[Dark Elves Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Beastbane, Cannot Be Parried, Whipcrack
Special Rules
Beastbane: The Beastmaster wielding a Beastlash causes
Fear in animals, any animal charged or wishing to charge a
Beastmaster with one of these weapons must first take a Fear
test as mentioned in the psychology section of the Mordheim
rules.
Cannot Be Parried: The Beastlash is a flexible weapon and
the Beastmaster use it with great expertise. Attempts to parry
its strikes are futile. A model attacked by a Beastlash may not
make parries with swords or bucklers.
Whipcrack: when the wielder charges they gain +1A for that
turn. This bonus attack is added after any other modifications.
When the wielder is charged they gain +1A that they may
only use against the charger. This additional attack will
‘strike first’. If the wielder is simultaneously charged by two
or more opponents they will still only receive a total of +1A.
If the wielder is using two whips at the same time then they
get +1A for the additional hand weapon, but only the first
whip gets the whipcrack +1A.

##### Boss Pole

Some influential Goblins carry badges of office, usually taking the
form of long wooden poles with an icon or sharp blade on the end.
[Forest Goblins Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Strike First, Unwieldy, Cavalry Bonus,
Animosity
Special Rules
Strike First: A warrior with a spear strikes first in the first
turn of hand-to-hand combat.
Unwieldy: A warrior with a spear may only use a shield or a
buckler in his other hand. He may not use a second weapon.
Cavalry Bonus: If using the rules for mounted models, a
mounted warrior armed with a spear receives a +1 Strength
bonus when he charges. This bonus only applies for that turn.
Animosity: The Hero with a boss pole and any Goblin
henchmen within 6" to ignore animosity.

##### Brazier Iron

```
The brazier iron is a weapon commonly used by witch hunters. It
consists of a long heft topped by an iron cup filled with burning hot
coals. In combat, the weapon takes on an eldritch quality as the
burning embers sear the air as it is swung, opponents are sent
reeling in flaming agony as they are set on fire
Range: Close combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Two-handed, Fire,
Special Rules
Two-handed: As a brazier requires two hands to use, a
model using a brazier may not use a shield, buckler or
additional weapon in close combat. If the model has a shield
he still gets a +1 bonus to his armour save against shooting.
Fire: Whenever you score a successful hit with the brazier
staff roll a D6. If you roll a 5+ the victim is set on fire. If the
warrior survives the attack they must score a 4+ in the
Recovery phase or suffer a Strength 4 hit each turn they are
on fire and will be unable to do anything other than move.
Other warriors from the same warband may help to put the
flames out if they wish. They must move into base-to-base
contact and score a 4+in the Recovery phase.
```
##### Censer

```
The censer is a hollow spiked metal ball attached to a long chain
and is swung like a flail. A plague infested shard of warpstone burns
inside the ball and emits pestilential fumes that nauseate the
opponents and may turn the wielder of the censer into a difficult
target to shoot at.
[Skaven, Clan Pestilens Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User +
Special Rule: Heavy, Two-Handed, Fog of Death
Special Rules
Heavy: The +2 Strength bonus applies only to the first turn
of hand to hand combat.
Two-handed: A censer requires two hands to be used and the
wielder cannot use a shield, buckler or additional weapon in
close combat.
Fog of Death: A model hit by the censer must take a
Toughness test. Roll a D6. If the result is higher than the
Toughness of the model taking the test, he will suffer an
automatic wound in addition to the censer hit. A result of 6
always inflicts a wound. Also the model wielding the censer
must take the test and will suffer a wound with a result of 6.
Models of undead and possessed are immune to the fog of
death and do not take the test. If the model wielding the
censer also has the fog-enhancing warpstone shards, he
becomes a difficult target to shoot at, and models targeting
him with missile weapons suffer a -1 penalty to hit.
```

##### Claw of the Old Ones

This is a very ancient weapon made from a strange metal that is
impervious to age and corrosion. The powers of this artefact can
only be unleashed through a ritual known only to a handful of
Amazons. The blade of this weapon glows white hot and can cut
through armour as if it were paper.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User +
Special Rule: No Save, Parry
Special Rules
No Save: The blade of the Claw can literally cut through
anything. A warrior wounded by a Claw receives no armour
save whatsoever.
Parry: User may parry as per normal rules.

##### Dagger

Daggers and knives are extremely common, and men are allowed to
carry them in enclaves where weapons are otherwise forbidden.
Many a warrior in Mordheim has died with a dagger in his back.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: +1 Enemy Armour Save
Special Rules
+1 Enemy Armour Save: Daggers are not the best weapons
to use for penetrating an enemy model’s armour. An enemy
wounded by a dagger gains a +1 bonus to his armour save,
and a 6+ armour save if he has none normally.

##### Disease Dagger

This dagger is permanently covered with a disgusting and
moulderish layer of green ooze that may infect those that are hit
with terrible diseases.
[Skaven, Clan Pestilens Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: -
Special Rule: +1 Enemy Armour Save
Special Rules
+1 Enemy Armour Save: Daggers are not the best weapons
to use for penetrating an enemy model’s armour. An enemy
wounded by a dagger gains a +1 bonus to his armour save,
and a 6+ armour save if he has none normally.
Infecting: a natural 6 on an hit roll means that the model hit
has been infected with the disease and that he must take a
Toughness test. Roll a D6. If the result is higher than the
Toughness of the model taking the test, he will suffer an
automatic wound in addition to the dagger hit. Models of
undead and possessed are immune to this disease and do not
take the test. A model wielding two Disease Daggers gains a
+1 Attack bonus for wielding two weapons and there is no
further effect, except that the chances of rolling an infecting 6
on the hit rolls are higher.

##### Double-Handed Weapon

```
A blow from a double-handed axe or sword can cut a foe in half and
break armour apart. It takes a long time to learn how to use these
weapons and even then only extremely strong men are able to wield
them effectively.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Two-handed, Strike Last,
Special Rules
Two-handed: A model armed with a double-handed weapon
may not use a shield, buckler or additional weapon in close
combat. If the model is equipped with a shield he will still get
a +1 bonus to his armour save against shooting.
Strike Last: Double-handed weapons are so heavy that the
model using them always strikes last, even when charging.
```
##### Dwarf Axe

```
Dwarf axes are smaller-hafted weapons made of lighter (but
stronger) materials than normal axes. Dwarf Warriors are specially
trained in their use and are able to use them as deftly as a Human
warrior might wield a sword.
[Dwarves Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Cutting Edge, Parry
Special Rules
Cutting Edge: Dwarf axes have an extra save modifier of -1,
so a model with Strength 4 using a Dwarf axe has a -2 save
modifier when he hits an opponent with the axe in close
combat.
Parry: Dwarf axes offer an excellent balance of defence and
offense. A model armed with a Dwarf axe may parry blows.
When his opponent rolls to hit, the model armed with a
Dwarf axe may roll a D6. If the score is greater than the
highest to hit score of his opponent, the model has parried the
blow and that attack is discarded. A model may not parry
attacks made with double or more its own Strength – they are
simply too powerful to be stopped. A model may not parry
more than one attack in a single Close Combat phase; a
model armed with two Dwarf axes (or a Dwarf axe and a
sword, etc) does not get to parry two attacks but may instead
re-roll a failed parry.

##### Fighting Claws

The martial arts practiced by Clan Eshin employ many unusual
weapons. The most famous of these are the Eshin Fighting Claws:
sharp metal blades attached to the paws of a Skaven warrior. It
takes a real expert to use them effectively, but an adept of Clan
Eshin is a fearsome opponent when armed this way.
[Skaven, Clan Eshin Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Pair, Climb, Parry, Cumbersome
Special Rules
Pair: Fighting Claws are traditionally used in pairs, one in
each hand. A warrior armed with Fighting Claws gets an
additional attack.
Climb: A Skaven equipped with Fighting Claws can add +
to his Initiative when making Climbing tests.
Parry: A Skaven armed with Fighting Claws may parry
blows and can re-roll a failed attempt once, in the same way
as a model armed with a sword and buckler.
Cumbersome: A model armed with Fighting Claws may not
use any other weapons in the entire battle.

##### Fist

The truly desperate, who don’t even own a knife, have to fight with
their bare hands. Needless to say, their chances of survival are
comparable to Halflings going without food for eight hours!
Note: The following rule only apply to warriors who have lost their
weapons. Creatures such as Zombies, animals, etc, ignore these
rules. Warriors using their fists can only ever make 1 attack.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user -
Special Rule: +1 Enemy Armour Save
Special Rules
+1 Enemy Armour Save: An enemy wounded by a fist gains
a +1 bonus to his armour save, and a 6+ armour save if he
normally has none.

##### Flail

The flail is a heavy weapon wielded with both hands. It normally
consists of heavy weights, often spiked, attached to a pole or handle
by means of heavy chains. Flails drain the user’s stamina quickly,
but are awesomely destructive in the hands of a skilled (or
unhinged) warrior.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Heavy, Two-handed
Special Rules
Heavy: A flail is extremely tiring to use and thus the +
Strength bonus applies only in the first turn of each hand-to-
hand combat.
Two-handed: As a flail requires two hands to use, a model
using a flail may not use a shield, buckler or additional
weapon in close combat. If the model has a shield he still gets
a +1 bonus to his armour save against shooting.

##### Halberd

```
The halberd’s heavy blade is mounted upon a sturdy shaft of
oak or steel and has a point like a spear and a cutting edge
like an axe. Since it can be used to chop as well as thrust, it is
an adaptable weapon, but is difficult to use inside buildings.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Two-handed
Special Rules
Two-handed: A model armed with a halberd may not use a
shield, buckler or additional weapon in close combat. If the
model has a shield he still gets a +1 bonus to his armour save
against shooting.
```
##### Hammer, staff, mace or club

```
Perhaps the simplest type of weapon, these brutal, bludgeoning
instruments range from primitive wooden clubs to elaborately
forged Dwarf hammers made from the finest steel. A blow from a
mace can easily crush a skull or knock a man unconscious.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Concussion
Special Rules
Concussion: Hammers and other bludgeoning weapons are
excellent to use for striking your enemy senseless. When
using a hammer, club or mace, a roll of 2-4 is treated as
stunned when rolling to see the extent of a model’s injuries.
```
##### Horseman’s Hammer

```
This is a great hammer similar to the ones used by the Knights of the
White Wolf. Far too bulky to use in one hand, a horseman’s hammer
is best suited to mounted combat, when the impetus of the horse may
be used to add to the power of the weapon.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Two-handed, Cavalry Charge
Special Rules
Two-handed: A model armed with a horseman’s hammer
may not use a shield, buckler, or additional weapon in close
combat. If the model is equipped with a shield he will still get
a +1 bonus to his Armour save against shooting.
Cavalry Charge: A model armed with a horseman’s hammer
may use the speed of his charge to increase the might of his
attacks. A model on a steed with a horseman’s hammer gains
a further +1 Strength bonus when he charges. This bonus
only applies for that turn.
```
##### Katar

```
This is an Arabian-style punch dagger. It has a handle
perpendicular to the blade and is used in a punching thrusting
manner.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: -1 Enemy Armour Save
Special Rules
-1 Enemy Armour Save: The Katar is a better weapon to use
for penetrating an enemy model’s armour. An enemy
wounded by a Katar gains a -1 bonus to his armour save.
```

##### Lance

Lances are long, heavy spears used by mounted shock troops to rip
through armour and fling their foes to the ground. They are the
chosen weapons of Knights Templar and other wealthy warriors. To
use a lance requires great skill and strength, and only the richest
warriors ride the heavy warhorses needed to wield these mighty
weapons effectively.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Cavalry Weapon, Cavalry Bonus
Special Rules
Cavalry Weapon: A warrior must own a warhorse to use a
lance, as it can only be used whilst he is on horseback.
Cavalry Bonus: If using optional rules for mounted models,
a warrior armed with a lance receives a +2 Strength bonus
when he charges. This bonus only applies for that turn.

##### Morning Star

A morning star consists of a wooden or steel shaft with heavy chains
that have spiked steel balls attached. It is very destructive and
requires great skill to wield effectively.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Heavy, Difficult to Use
Special Rules
Heavy: The morning star is extremely tiring to use, so its +
Strength bonus applies only in the first turn of each hand-to-
hand combat.
Difficult to Use: A model with a morning star may not use a
second weapon or buckler in his other hand because it
requires all his skill to wield it. He may carry a shield as
normal though.

##### Pike

The Pike is somewhat longer than a spear and is weighted so that it
can be wielded efficiently between the trees, underbrush and
between narrow buildings.
Range: Close Combat (3”)
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Strike First, Unwieldy, Length
Special Rules
Strike First: A warrior with a Pike strikes first in the first
turn of hand-to-hand combat, even if charged with a model
with a spear. After the initial round of combat resolve strikes
in Initiative order. The model can change to normal hand-to-
hand weapons after the initial round.
Unwieldy: A warrior with a spear may only use a shield or a
buckler in his other hand. He may not use a second weapon.
Length: Because of size and weight of the Pike only models
of man-sized or larger creatures can use pikes. Skaven,
Skinks, Halflings, etc cannot.

##### Plague Sword

```
Clan Pestilens has created a hellish weapon, called the plague
sword. These warpstone blades carry disease and corruption with
each strike. The infection caused with each blow renders the
wounded extremely ill, and will disable even the strongest foe.
[Skaven, Clan Pestilens only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Parry, Contagion
Special Rules
Parry: Plague swords offer an excellent balance of defence
and offence. A model armed with a plague sword may parry
blows. When his opponent rolls to hit, the model armed with
a sword may roll a D6. If the score is greater than the highest
to hit score of his opponent, the model has parried the blow,
and that attack is discarded. A model may not parry attacks
made with double or more its own Strength – they are simply
too powerful to be stopped.
Contagion: Each blow of the plague sword carries with it a
host of diseases and pestilence. Every successful hit with the
plague sword causes two wounds. Armour saves may be
applied as normal.
```
##### Punisher Whip

```
Punisher whips are used by the Pack Masters of Clan Moulder to
train their beasts. These fiendish devices are made of braided
leather, filled with razor sharp spikes. A much larger spike tips the
whip, and the Pack Masters use this quite effectively to inflict pain.
[Skaven, Clan Moulder only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Animal Scourge, Cannot Be Parried,
Whipcrack
Special Rules
Animal Scourge: The Pack Masters of Clan Moulder learn
to use these whips for the purpose of training animals. The
beasts of Clan Moulder learn that these whips are to be feared
above everything else. Any beast (Giant Rat, Wolf Rats, or
Rat Ogre) in the Clan Moulder Warband may re-roll any
failed Leadership-based test if within 6” of a model armed
with a punisher whip. On other animals, such as horses and
war dogs, are intimidated by the whistling scream of a
punisher whip passing through the air. Any animal not in the
warband, including other Skaven warbands, are affected by
fear with regards to charging a model armed with these
whips.
Cannot Be Parried: The Punisher Whip is a flexible weapon
and the warrior use it with great expertise. Attempts to parry
its strikes are futile. A model attacked by a Punisher Whip
may not make parries with swords or bucklers.
Whipcrack: When the wielder charges they gain +1A for
that turn. This bonus attack is added after any other
modifications. When the wielder is charged they gain +1A
that they may only use against the charger. This additional
attack will ‘strike first’. If the wielder is simultaneously
charged by two or more opponents they will still only receive
a total of +1A. If the wielder is using two whips at the same
time then they get +1A for the additional hand weapon, but
only the first whip gets the whipcrack +1A.

##### Rapier

The rapier is a long thing blade commonly used by dualists. It is a
deadly, shard weapon capable of delivering a multitude of blows but
lacks the power of a broadsword.
Range: Close combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Parry, Barrage, Armour Save,
Special Rules
Parry: Like all swords, you may use a rapier to parry in hand
to hand combat. When your opponent scores a hit you must
roll a D6. If you can score greater than the highest 'to hit' roll
you have parried the blow and the attack is discarded.
Barrage: A warrior armed with a rapier rolls to hit and
wound as normal. However, if you mange to hit your
opponent but fail to wound, you may attack again just as if
you had another attack but at –1 to hit (down to a maximum
to needing a 6 to hit). You may continue attacking as long as
you hit and it is possible to strike your opponent many times,
particularly if your warrior has more then one attack on his
profile.
Armour Save: Because a rapier is a very light sword that
lacks the thick armour breaking blade of the broadsword,
armour saves are made at +1

##### Saerath

The Saerath is a weapon commonly used by the wood Elves, the
Saerath or spear-stave is a staff with sword-like blades attached to
each end.
[Wood Elves Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +1
Special Rule: Parry, Extra Attack
Special Rules
Parry: Like all swords, you may use a Saerath to parry in
hand to hand combat. When your opponent scores a hit you
must roll a D6. If you can score greater than the highest 'to
hit' roll you have parried the blow and the attack is discarded.
Extra Attack: the Saerath acts like the user is armed with
two swords.

##### Scythe

Scythes are normally implements used in the fields by farmers. It is
rare to see them wielded as weapons of warfare. However, the
scythe also carries with it an image of death. It is the symbol of the
Grim Reaper, the representation of famine and starvation and
disease through the lack of harvested food. Priests of Morr, when
they need to, may carry a Scythe as a weapon.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User +1
Special Rule: Difficult to use, Two-Handed
Special Rules
Difficult to Use: A model with a scythe may not use a
second weapon or buckler in his other hand because it
requires all his skill to wield it. He may carry a shield as
normal though.
Two-handed: A model armed with a scythe may not use a
shield, buckler, or additional weapon in close combat. If the
model is equipped with a shield he will still get a +1 bonus to
his Armour save against shooting.

Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Cannot Be Parried, Whipcrack, +1 Enemy

strikes are futile. A model attacked by a whip may not make
parries with swords or bucklers.
Whipcrack: when the wielder charges they gain +1A for that
turn. This bonus attack is added after any other modifications.
When the wielder is charged they gain +1A that they may
only use against the charger. This additional attack will
‘strike first’. If the wielder is simultaneously charged by two
or more opponents they will still only receive a total of +1A.

get +1A for the additional hand weapon, but only the first
whip gets the whipcrack +1A.
+1 Enemy Armour Save: An enemy wounded by a whip
gains a +1 bonus to his armour save, and a 6+ armour save if
he normally has none.
Poisoned: The Serpent Whip is treated as being coated with
black lotus.

One of the traditional weapons of the Sisterhood, the Warhammer
echoes Ghal-Maraz, the great hammer of Sigmar himself.
[Sister of Sigmar Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User +1
Special Rule: Concussion, Holy Weapon
Special Rules
Concussion: Warhammers are excellent at striking people
senseless. When using a Warhammer in close combat a roll
of 2-4 is treated as Stunned when rolling on the Injury chart.
Holy Weapon: Each Warhammer is blessed by the High
Matriarch herself before it is handed to the Sisters. The
Warhammer has a +1 bonus on all to wound rolls against any
Possessed or Undead models. Note that you will still need to

Only Matriarchs and Sister Superiors may carry two
Sigmarite Warhammers.

##### Spiked Gauntlet

The Spiked Gauntlet is a weapon commonly used in the Pit Fights.
Act like a blade and a buckler
[Pit Fighters Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Parry
Special Rules
Parry: Spiked Gauntlet offer an excellent balance of defence
and offence. A model armed with a Spiked Gauntlet may
parry blows. When his opponent rolls to hit, the model armed
with a Spiked Gauntlet may roll a D6. If the score is greater
than the highest to hit score of his opponent, the model has
parried the blow, and that attack is discarded. A model may
not parry attacks made with double or more its own Strength

- they are simply too powerful to be stopped. The model with
Spiked Gauntlet may re-roll any failed parries once. (And no,
your Heroes cannot learn to use it!)

##### Squig Prodder

[Goblins Only]
Special Rules
This item is a long pole with a trio of spikes at the end. It is
used by Goblin Squig herders to keep their livestock in line.
Cave Squigs will recognize a Squig prodder and
automatically give the bearer more respect, as they’ve all
been on its pointy end more than once! To represent this, a
Goblin with a Squig prodder can keep all Cave Squigs within
12" from going wild, instead of the normal 6" (see the
Minderz special rule under the Cave Squig entry). In
addition, a Squig prodder is treated exactly like a spear in
hand-to-hand combat.

##### Star-Blade

Of the many strange weapons the Amazons possess the Star-blade is
built like an Amazonian dagger. It is usually painted exotic colours
and contains magical properties that enhance the fighting prowess
of the Amazons.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: +1 Enemy Armour Save, Parry
Special Rules
+1 Enemy Armour Save: Star-blades are not the best
weapons to use for penetrating an enemy model’s armour. An
enemy wounded by a Star-blade gains a +1 bonus to his
armour save, and a 6+ armour save if he has none normally.
Parry: Star-blade offers an excellent balance of defence and
offence. A model armed with a Star-blade may parry the first
successful blow of any combat on a 4+. The model has
parried the blow, and that attack is discarded. A model may
not parry attacks made with double or more its own Strength

- they are simply too powerful to be stopped.

##### Star-Sword

```
This is an ancient and legendary sword that can cut through armour
as if it were a leaf.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +1
Special Rule: No Save, Parry
Special Rules
No Save: The great power of the Star-sword ignores all
armour saves except for ward and Dodge saves.
Parry: Star-sword offers an excellent balance of defence and
offence. A model armed with a Star-sword may parry blows.
When his opponent rolls to hit, the model armed with a sword
may roll a D6. If the score is greater than the highest to hit
score of his opponent, the model has parried the blow, and
that attack is discarded. A model may not parry attacks made
with double or more its own Strength – they are simply too
powerful to be stopped.
```
##### Steel Whip

```
Another weapon unique to the Sisterhood is the steel whip, made
from barbed steel chains.
[Sister of Sigmar Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Cannot Be Parried, Whipcrack
Special Rules
Cannot Be Parried: The steel whip is a flexible weapon and
the Priestesses use it with great expertise. Attempts to parry
its strikes are futile. A model attacked by a steel whip may
not make parries with swords or bucklers.
Whipcrack: when the wielder charges they gain +1A for that
turn. This bonus attack is added after any other modifications.
When the wielder is charged they gain +1A that they may
only use against the charger. This additional attack will
‘strike first’. If the wielder is simultaneously charged by two
or more opponents they will still only receive a total of +1A.
If the wielder is using two whips at the same time then they
get +1A for the additional hand weapon, but only the first
whip gets the whipcrack +1A.
```
##### Sword

```
The sword is often referred to as the ‘king of weapons’. The most
common sword available, the broadsword of the Empire, is a
masterpiece by the standards of any smith: four full feet of gleaming
steel, double-edged and razor-sharp.
Swords are much more effective weapons than crude clubs and axes,
though learning to use a sword is a long and difficult process. It
takes years to truly master this weapon – most warriors in
Mordheim die long before they get this far!
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Parry
Special Rules
Parry: Swords offer an excellent balance of defence and
offence. A model armed with a sword may parry blows.
When his opponent rolls to hit, the model armed with a sword
may roll a D6. If the score is greater than the highest to hit
score of his opponent, the model has parried the blow, and
that attack is discarded. A model may not parry attacks made
with double or more its own Strength – they are simply too
powerful to be stopped.

##### Sword Breaker

The sword breaker is a specialist weapon wrought by only the most
talented sword smiths. Next to the hilt are two prongs concealed
within the blade that can be used to trap an opponent's blade,
twisting and snapping it with a single, well time movement.
Range: Close combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Parry, Trap Blade
Special Rules
Parry: The sword breaker allows the wielder to parry the
attacks of his opponent's in close combat. When your
opponent scores a hit, roll a D6. If you can roll greater than
the highest 'to hit' of your opponent, you have parried the
attack and the blow is wasted.
Trap Blade: Whenever you make a successful parry attempt
roll a D6. If you score a 4+, you break the weapon your
opponent was using. The weapon is now useless and they
must use another one, or if they have no other weapon, resort
to unarmed combat.

##### Weeping Blades

The adepts of Clan Eshin use weapons called Weeping Blades,
murderous swords constructed with a small amount of warpstone in
their structure. A Weeping Blade constantly sweats a deadly
corrosive venom.
[Skaven, Clan Eshin Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Pair, Venomous, Parry
Special Rules
Pair: Weeping Blades are traditionally used in pairs, one in
each hand. A warrior armed with Weeping Blades gets an
additional attack.
Venomous: The venom of Weeping Blades will enter the
blood of the victim and ravage his organs and muscles. These
weapons count as being permanently coated in black lotus
(see the Equipment section). No additional poison may be
applied to Weeping Blades.
Parry: Weeping Blades are swords and can be used for
parrying.

##### Whip

```
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User -1
Special Rule: Cannot Be Parried, Whipcrack, +1 Enemy
Armour Save
Special Rules
Cannot Be Parried: The whip is a flexible weapon and the
warrior use it with great expertise. Attempts to parry its
strikes are futile. A model attacked by a whip may not make
parries with swords or bucklers.
Whipcrack: when the wielder charges they gain +1A for that
turn. This bonus attack is added after any other modifications.
When the wielder is charged they gain +1A that they may
only use against the charger. This additional attack will
‘strike first’. If the wielder is simultaneously charged by two
or more opponents they will still only receive a total of +1A.
If the wielder is using two whips at the same time then they
get +1A for the additional hand weapon, but only the first
whip gets the whipcrack +1A.
+1 Enemy Armour Save: An enemy wounded by a whip
gains a +1 bonus to his armour save, and a 6+ armour save if
he normally has none.
```
#### Close Combat Upgrades

##### Fog-enhancing Warpstone Shards

```
[Skaven Clan Pestilens Only]
When put inside a censer these warpstone shards have the
peculiar characteristic of making the resulting clouds of
pestilential fumes thicker than usual. The wielder of a censer
who also have some fog-enhancing warpstone shards is a
difficult target to shoot at, and other models suffer a -1
penalty to hit when targeting him with missile weapons (Clan
Pestilens members use this item instead of the Elven Cloak).
```
#### Special Weapon Types

##### Cold Metal Weapons

Wood Elves do not use forges; they have a special smithing style
known by outsides as “Cold Forging”. Cold Forging is a mix of
both physical and magical techniques known only to the Wood
Elves. The Metal which comes from this Cold Forging technique is
call Cold Metal.
Special Rules
Because Wood elves do not use forges, they do the smithing
in a special, “cold“, way. This gives the weapon such a
special flexibility in creating; it seems to have sharper edges.
It gives the weapon a +1 to hit in close combat and costs
three times the price of a normal weapon of its kind.

##### Dark Steel Weapons

```
Dark Steel Weapons are forged in the city of Hag Graef, the Dark
Crag. They are fashioned from Black steel, a rare form of steel
found deep within the mountains around the city. Dark Steel
weapons have wicked protrusions and serrated edges, which inflict
serious damage on an opponent.
Special Rules
The Weapons commonly made of Dark Steel are swords,
daggers or other bladed weapons. These weapons upgraded to
Dark Steel retain all of their abilities (i.e. swords can parry,
daggers grant an armour save of 6) also costs three times the
price of a normal weapon of its kind.
Critical Damage: Dark blades inflict serious damage on
their opponents, when rolling on the critical hit chart a Dark
blade will add +1 to the result.
Wicked Edge: Dark blades are set with sharp protrusions
and serrated edges which inflict serious damage on an
opponent, a roll of 2-4 on the injury table is a Stunned result.
```

##### Gromril Weapons

Only a Dwarf Runesmith can forge a weapon from Gromril, a rare
meteoric iron. A blade fashioned from this metal will stay keen for a
thousand years.
Special Rules
A Gromril weapon has an extra -1 save modifier, and costs
four times the price of a normal weapon of its kind. You may
choose which type of hand-to-hand weapon is offered to you
as explained in the Trading section.

##### Ithilmar Weapons

```
Elven blades are forged from priceless Ithilmar, an extremely light
but strong metal, found only in the fabled Elven kingdoms. A few of
these weapons are occasionally found in the Old World and these
are normally spoils of war, taken by the Norse raiders who pillage
the coastal settlements of the Elves.
Special Rules
An Ithilmar weapon gives its user +1 Initiative in hand-to-
hand combat, and costs three times the price of a normal
weapon of its kind. You may choose which hand-to-hand
weapon is offered to you as explained in the Trading section.
```
#### Missile Weapons

##### Blowpipe

The blowpipe is a short hollow tube which can be used to shoot
poisoned darts. While the darts by themselves are too small to cause
significant damage, the poison used by the Skaven can cause
searing agony and eventual death. The other advantage of a
blowpipe is that it is silent, and a well-hidden shooter can fire the
darts undetected.
[Skaven, Forest Goblins & Lizardman Only]
Range: 8"
Strength: 1
Special Rule: Save +1, Poison, Stealthy
Special Rules
Save +1: Allows the victim +1 to their Save, or if they have
no save roll, they may roll a 6+
Poison: The needles fired by a blowpipe are coated in a
venom very similar in its effects to the Black Lotus (if you
roll a 6 on the To Hit roll, the victim is automatically
wounded). A blowpipe cannot cause critical hits. This
weapon has a positive armour save modifier, so a model that
normally has a save of 5+ will get a save of 4+ against a
blowpipe dart. Even models that normally do not have an
armour save will get a 6+ save to take into account protection
offered by clothes, fur or the like.
Stealthy: A Skaven armed with a blowpipe can fire while
hidden without revealing his position to the enemy. The
target model can take an Initiative test in order to try to spot
the firing Skaven. If the test is successful, the Skaven no
longer counts as hidden.

##### Bolas

```
Bolas are a set of three bronze balls on strings tied together. They
are thrown similar to a sling and are rotated around the head for
speed. The bolas is a hunting weapon and doesn’t harm the animal.
It immobilizes it and allows the hunter to either subdue it or put it
out with his spear.
[Lizardmen & Amazons Only]
Range: 16"
Strength: -
Special Rule: Dangerous, Entangle, One use only
Special Rules
Dangerous: If the to hit roll is a natural 1, the bolas brains
the caster with a S3 hit.
Entangle: A model hit by a bolas isn’t hurt, but is entangled
and the model is unable to move and suffers a WS penalty of
-2 in hand-to-hand combat. The model may still shoot and
may try to free itself in the recovery phase. If he rolls 4+ on a
D6 he is freed and may move and fight normally.
One use only: Once the Bolas has been thrown the Bolas
cannot be used for the rest of the battle, They are
automatically recovered after each battle.

##### Bolt Thrower

Bolt or dart throwers are large crossbow that shoots a spear-sized
missile. They are so large that they mounted on their own stand,
often with wheels so they can be pivoted easily.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Bolt Thrower * - - - 5 3 - - -

Range: 36"
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Hard to Fire, Large Target, Movement,
Save Modifier
Hard to Fire: Firing the Bolt Thrower requires a good crew,
a maintained weapon, and technical knowledge. The Bolt
Thrower can fire once every other turn with one crewman,
and each turn with two. All of the normal shooting rules
apply, but no Shooting skills apply to the Bolt Thrower. The
Bolt Thrower may not move and fire in the same turn.
Large Target: The Bolt Thrower is still an obvious target
even from far away, and can always be targeted by enemy
shooting.
Movement: Even the Bolt Thrower requires a good crew to
move it. A single crewmember can move the Bolt Thrower at
haft his movement, two crewmembers can move it at their
full movement.
Save Modifier: Bolt Thrower is even better at penetrating
armour than their Strength 5 suggests. A warrior wounded by
a Bolt Thrower must make his armour save with a -2
modifier.

##### Bow

The bow is carried by most races and used extensively in warfare. It
is a compact yet powerful weapon, that is cheap to make and easy to
maintain.
Range: 24"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: None

##### Crossbow Pistol

Crossbow pistols are masterpieces made by expert weapon-smiths.
They are miniature crossbows with all the power and accuracy of
the real thing. As these weapons may be easily concealed, they are
the favoured weapon of assassins.
Range: 10"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Shoot In Hand-to-Hand Combat
Special Rules
Shoot in hand-to-hand combat: A model armed with a
crossbow pistol may shoot it in the first round of a hand-to-
hand combat and this shot is always resolved first, before any
blows are struck. This shot has an extra -2 to hit penalty. Use
model’s Ballistic Skill to see whether it hits or not. This
bonus attack is in addition to any close combat weapon
attacks.

##### Crossbow

```
A crossbow consists of a short, strong bow-stave mounted on a
wooden or steel stock. The crossbows of the Empire are made of
steel and often include a winding mechanism to draw back the
string. It takes a long time to prepare a crossbow, but a bolt fired
from one has a tremendous range and can penetrate armour easily.
Crossbows take much longer than other bows to make, so they are
expensive and relatively rare weapons. Still, they are the preferred
weapon of many in Mordheim because of their power and long
range.
Range: 30"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Move or Fire
Special Rules
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a crossbow on the
same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face your target
or to stand up.
```
##### Elf Bow

```
Elven bows are the finest missile weapons of their kind. Constructed
from Ithilmar or wood from the Elf forests, with strings woven from
the hair of Elf maidens, Elven bows are far superior to any missile
weapons made by other races. In the hands of an Elven archer, the
Elf bow is a truly potent weapon, its long range and penetrating
power making it far superior to any bow made by humans.
Range: 36"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: -1 Save Modifier
Special Rules
-1 Save Modifier: An Elf bow has a -1 save modifier on
armour saves against it.
```
##### Javelins

```
Javelins are short throwing spears specially weighted to travel quite
a distance. Although they have a much reduced range when
compared to an arrow they can cause quite considerable damage
when thrown by a person of great strength.
Range: 8"
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Thrown Weapon
Special Rules
Thrown Weapon: Javelins are thrown weapons and the
warrior suffers no penalties for moving and shooting.
```
##### Long Bow

```
A long bow is made of alternating layers of either yew or elm. A
skilled archer can hit a chosen leaf on a tree from three hundred
paces with this weapon. The long bow is favoured by experienced
archers due to its great reach and accuracy.
Range: 30"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: None
```

##### Poison Wind Globes

Poisoned wind globes are fragile spheres of a caustic hellish liquid
warpstone. When the globe is thrown and the gas is released and it
dissolves through flesh and armour with equal ease.
[Skaven, Clan Skryre Only]
Range: 8"
Strength: Special
Special Rule: Thrown Weapon
Special: Place the Small Blast template within 8” and roll to
hit using the Ballistic Skill. If a hit is rolled, then roll a D6 for
each model under the template. On a roll of 4+, the target
takes a single wound, immediately, with no Strength or
Toughness roll or armour save possible. If the globe misses
its intended target, roll a D3 and a scatter die.
Thrown Weapon: Poison Wind Globes are thrown weapons
and the warrior suffers no penalties for moving and shooting.
(Rare 7 for any Clan Skryre Skavens)

##### Repeater Bolt Thrower

Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Repeater Bolt Thrower * - - - 5 3 - - -

Range: 36"
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Fire Twice, Hard to Fire, Large Target,
Movement, Save Modifier
[Elves Only]
Fire Twice: Repeater Bolt Thrower may choose to fire twice
per turn with an extra -1 to hit penalty on both shots.
Hard to Fire: Firing the Repeater Bolt Thrower requires a
good crew, a maintained weapon, and technical knowledge.
The Repeater Bolt Thrower can fire once every other turn
with one crewman, and each turn with two. All of the normal
shooting rules apply, but no Shooting skills apply to the
Repeater Bolt Thrower. The Repeater Bolt Thrower may not
move and fire in the same turn.
Large Target: The Repeater Bolt Thrower is still an obvious
target even from far away, and can always be targeted by
enemy shooting.
Movement: Even the Repeater Bolt Thrower requires a good
crew to move it. A single crewmember can move the
Repeater Bolt Thrower at haft his movement, two
crewmembers can move it at their full movement.
Save Modifier: Repeater Bolt Thrower are even better at
penetrating armour than their Strength 5 suggests. A warrior
wounded by a Repeater Bolt Thrower must make his armour
save with a -2 modifier.

##### Repeater Crossbow

```
Repeater crossbows are extremely complex devices, expensive to
acquire and difficult to make. While this makes them rare, they
certainly have their uses: they can rain a deadly hail of bolts on
enemies, and a warrior using one may move quite fast and still fire
his weapon.
Range: 24"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: Fire Twice
Special Rules
Fire Twice: A model armed with a repeater crossbow may
choose to fire twice per turn with an extra -1 to hit penalty on
both shots.
```
##### Short Bow

```
Short bows are small, short-ranged bows that are cheap and require
little strength to use. Some cavalry carry a shortened bow which is
easier to shoot from horseback than a larger bow. Halflings also use
short bows, as they lack the strength and height required to use a
long bow.
Range: 16"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: None
```
##### Sling

```
Slings are rarely used, mainly because they are no more powerful
than bows and have a shorter range. A sling is little more than a
looped strip of cloth or leather into which a stone is placed. The
sling is whirled about the slinger’s head and the sling stone is then
released towards the target. While this weapon is looked down upon
by most archers, a skilled slinger can slay a man from a
considerable distance, and the ammunition is easy to find: rocks are
everywhere and free!
Range: 18"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: Fire Twice at Half Range
Special Rules
Fire Twice at Half Range: A slinger may fire twice in the
shooting phase if he does not move in the movement phase.
He cannot shoot over half range (9") though, if he fires twice.
If the model fires twice then each shot is at -1 to hit.
```
##### Sunstaff

```
The Sunstaff is a long tubular stick that is made from a strange
multicoloured metal with one end hollow like a tube. Strange runes
are carved along its length and a large gemstone is set into the
pommel. Despite being extremely ancient (Elf Lore Masters of the
White Tower of Hoeth claim to have found a similar device that they
surmise is more than 20,000 years old – older than the Elven race
itself!), the wielder of the Sunstaff can discharge a beam of energy
akin to the rays of the sun.
Range: 24"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Accurate, No Save
Special Rules
Accurate: The Sunstaff does not suffer the usual -1 modifier
to hit for long range.
No Save: The beam from a Sunstaff can literally cut through
anything. A warrior wounded by a Sunstaff receives no
armour save whatsoever.

##### Sun Gauntlet

This, as with all strange arcane Amazon items, is made from an
unknown multicoloured metal that is impervious to damage or
corrosion. It is covered in strange runes and a bright gemstone is
set into the hilt. In many ways this weapon resembles a Blackpowder
pistol. It can be held in one hand and when pointed at an enemy
unleashes a blinding beam of energy like the Sunstaff
Range: 12"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Accurate, No Save, Hand-to-Hand
Special Rules
Accurate: The Sun Gauntlet does not suffer the usual -1
modifier to hit for long range.
No Save: he beam from a Sun Gauntlet can literally cut
through anything. A warrior wounded by a Sun Gauntlet
receives no armour save whatsoever.
Hand-to-Hand: The Sun Gauntlet can be used with another
close combat weapon in hand to hand combat with Strength 4
and no armour save. Because it does not require prepared
shot, this bonus attack may be used in each turn of combat.

##### Throwing Stars/Knives

Throwing stars are used mainly by the assassins of the sinister
House of Shadows, or by street thugs who specialize in ambushing
the unwary. A perfectly balanced knife thrown from behind has
ended the life of many a noble and merchant in Mordheim.
Throwing knives are not suitable for close combat, as their balance
makes them unwieldy in close quarters.
Range: 6"
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Thrown Weapon
Special Rules
Thrown Weapon: Models using throwing stars or knives do
not suffer penalties for range or moving as these weapons are
perfectly balanced for throwing. They cannot be used in close
combat.

##### Tufenk

```
This is a blowpipe that projects alchemical fire about eight feet
causing burning damage.
Range: 8"
Strength: 2
Special Rule: May fire every other turn, Causes fire
damage.
Special Rules
Causes fire damage: If you hit roll a D6, on a 4+ your
opponent is set on fire. They must roll a D6 each Recovery
phase, on a 4+ they extinguish the fire or they immediately
suffer a S4 hit and may only move. Friendly models may help
in extinguishing the model that is ablaze. They must be in
base-to-base contact and need to roll a 4+ on a D6. Against
dry targets like Mummies they are Strength 3 and on a 2+ on
1D6 the Mummy catches fire.
Prepare Shot: The Tufenk takes a complete turn to reload,
so your model may only fire every other turn.
```
#### Missile Weapon Upgrades

##### Black Arrow

One shot, non recoverable item. Anyone wounded by the
Arrow is immediately put Out of Action regardless of
remaining wounds. Strength as Bow used to fire it.

##### Composite / Compound

A compound or composite bow uses different materials to make a
better Bow. The bow is usually only limited to the users own
strength and can be considerably more effective than a normal bow.
A Bow, Short bow or Longbow may be purchased as a
Compound bow. The cost is twice that of a bow’s normal
cost. A compound Bow shoots 50% further and can use the
strength of the user instead of its normal Strength.

##### Fire Arrows

Fire arrows are tied with rags soaked in oil up in a tight
pouch that explodes bunched up in a tight pouch that
explodes when hitting the target, setting clothes and
equipment alight. If you hit with a fire arrow roll a D6. If you
score a 4+ your opponent has been set on fire. If the warrior

```
survives the attack they must score a 4+ in the Recovery
phase or suffer a Strength 4 hit each turn they are on fire and
will be unable to do anything other then move. Other warriors
from the same warband may help to put the flames out if they
wish. They must move into base-to-base contact and score a
4+ in the Recovery phase.
```
##### Hunting Arrows

```
The best hunting arrows are made by the hunters of Drakwald
forest. They have sharp, barbed arrowheads which cause
excruciating pain when they hit their target. A skilled archer can
severely injure his target with a single arrow.
A model using a short bow, bow, long bow or Elf bow may
use these arrows. They add +1 to all Injury rolls.
These are available to Heroes at the time of their initial
recruitment without having to roll for Rarity. If you wish to
subsequently purchase this item during the Trading and
Exploration stages of the game, then you would have to roll
for Rarity as normal.
```

#### Blackpowder Weapons

Blackpowder weapons are only a very recent invention in the Warhammer world. They are often unreliable and
temperamental but they do hit exceedingly hard and armour offers almost no protection, as their lead bullets can penetrate
even the strongest breastplate or shield.
Most blackpowder weapons are bought from Dwarfs at great expense, though some of the forges of Nuln and Altdorf have
started to experiment with making handguns.

##### Blunderbuss

A blunderbuss is a primitive Blackpowder weapon, which fires a
hail of lead balls, rusty bolts, bent nails, and other assorted scrap
metal. It is a powerful, if erratic, weapon and takes such a long time
to load that most warriors discard it after the first shot.
Range: Special
Strength: 3
Special Rule: Shot, Fire Once
Special Rules
Shot: When your model fires the blunderbuss, draw a line
16" long and 1" wide in any direction from the firer (the line
must be absolutely straight). Any and all models in its path
are automatically hit by a Strength 3 hit.
Fire Once: It takes a very long time to load a blunderbuss so
it may only be fired it once per battle.

##### Duelling Pistol

A duelling pistol is a work of art, and a gunsmith labours long and
hard to produce a single example. They are often carried by
Imperial nobles to solve disputes over love and honour, and many a
noble has died at dawn in a duel over some grievance.
Duelling pistols are prohibitively expensive weapons and common
warriors rarely have them. Even if they do manage to steal or buy
one, the ammunition is prohibitively expensive.
Some of the wealthiest warriors in Mordheim carry duelling pistols
as status symbols, commanding great respect, admiration and envy.
Range: 10"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Accuracy, Prepare Shot, Save Modifier,
Hand-to-Hand
Special Rules
Accuracy: A duelling pistol is built for accuracy as a skilled
duelist is able to hit a coin from twenty paces. All shots and
close combat attacks from a duelling pistol have a +1 bonus
to hit.
Prepare Shot: A duelling pistol takes a complete turn to
reload, so your model may only fire every other turn. If he
has a brace of duelling pistols he may fire every turn.
Save Modifier: Duelling pistols are even better at
penetrating armour than their Strength 4 suggests. A warrior
wounded by a duelling pistol must make his armour save
with a -2 modifier.
Hand-to-Hand: Duelling pistols can be used in hand-to-hand
combat as well as for shooting. A model armed with a
duelling pistol and another close combat weapon gains +1
Attack, which is resolved at Strength 4 with a -2 save
modifier. This bonus attack can be used only once per
combat. If you are firing a brace of duelling pistols, your
model can fight with 2 Attacks in the first turn of close
combat. These attacks are resolved with a model’s Weapon
Skill like any normal close combat attack and likewise may
be parried. Successful hits are resolved at Strength 4 and with
a -2 save modifier, regardless of the firer’s Strength.

##### Hand-held Mortar

```
The explosive power of a mortar, in a small enough package to be
carried by a single man, the Hand-Held Mortar enables a warrior to
launch an explosive into the midst of the enemy, sowing death and
disorder.
Range: 24"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Experimental, Explosive Radius, Move or
Fire, Prepare Shot, Save Modifier, Scatter,
SPECIAL RULE
Experimental: The Hand-Held Mortar is always subject to
the optional Blackpowder Weapons, even if they are not
normally used in your campaign. On any result other than
“BOOM!” the weapon has jammed or run out of loaded
barrels and must be reloaded.
Explosive Radius: After determining the final landing spot,
the explosion created by the bomb will cover a small area.
Place the small blast template on the final landing spot, any
models under the template will each take a single S4 hit from
the blast.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Hand-Held
Mortar in the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to
face your target or stand up from knocked down.
Prepare Shot: The Hand-Held Mortar must be reloaded after
firing, so may only be fired every other turn.
Save Modifier: Hand-Held Mortar are even better at
penetrating armour than their Strength value of 4 suggests. A
model wounded by a Hand-Held Mortar must take its armour
save with a -2 modifier.
Scatter: If the warrior misses his roll to hit, the shot will land
2D6” in a random direction (determined using a Warhammer
directional die, using the “clock-face method” of scattering,
or whatever other method the players can agree to).

##### Handgun

A handgun is a simple firearm. The quality of construction varies
ranging from the crude wooden ‘hakbuts’ of the artillery school of
Nuln, to the more sophisticated Dwarf firearms that have levers and
springs which hold the burning match, and triggers which release
the firing mechanism and fire the gun. Handguns are not terribly
reliable weapons: the gun barrel occasionally tends to explode
violently or the powder fails to ignite. But the weapon has a great
range and tremendous penetrating power, making a mockery of even
the thickest armour. In Mordheim, handguns are rare and
expensive, but a warband which can boast such a weapon will
command respect from all its rivals.
Range: 24"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Prepare Shot, Save Modifier,
Special Rules
Prepare Shot: A handgun takes a complete turn to reload, so
you may only fire it every other turn.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a handgun in the
same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face your target
or stand up.
Save Modifier: Handguns are even better at penetrating
armour than their Strength 4 suggests. A warrior wounded by
a handgun must take its armour save with a -2 modifier.

##### Hochland Long Hunting Rifle

Hochland is a province famed for its hunters, and the preferred
weapon of its nobility when they go hunting is a long-ranged rifle.
They are extremely rare and precious weapons, and only the most
experienced weapon smiths are capable of manufacturing them.

Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Hochland long
rifle in the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face
your target or stand up from knocked down.
Prepare Shot: A Hochland long rifle takes a complete turn
to reload, so you may only fire it every other turn.
Pick Target: A model armed with a Hochland long rifle can
target any enemy model in sight, not just the closest one.
Save Modifier: Hochland long rifles are even better at
penetrating armour than their Strength 4 suggests. A warrior
wounded by a long rifle must make his armour save with a -2
modifier.

##### Jezzail Rifle

```
Jezzail are warpstone-firing rifle designed by the engineers of Clan
Skryre. The blast of a Jezzail can be heard over great distances, as
can the screams of the targets.
[Skaven, Clan Skryre Only]
Range: 36"
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Heavy, Move or Fire, Multiple Impacts,
Prepare Shot, Pick Target, Save Modifier,
Special Rules
Heavy: The Jezzail Rifle is a large heavy weapon and at
some times needed two to carry it. If used by only one then
the shooter has a -1 to movement, a -1 to hit and cannot
charge. If the shooter(s) have to flee then they would drop the
Jezzail Rifle. The Jezzail Rifle counts as being lost.
If the user has an Assistant, then there is no movement and no
to hit penalties.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Jezzail Rifle in
the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face your
target or stand up from knocked down.
Multiple Impacts: the Jezzail Rifle fires a warpstone pellet
at an extremely high velocity. The pellet can penetrate
armour and flesh with ease. So any target hit cause by the
Jezzail Rifle causes d3 wounds.
Prepare Shot: A Jezzail Rifle takes a complete turn to
reload, so you may only fire it every other turn.
Pick Target: A model armed with a Jezzail Rifle can target
any enemy model in sight, not just the closest one.
Save Modifier: Jezzail Rifles are even better at penetrating
armour than their Strength 5 suggests. A warrior wounded by
a Jezzail Rifle must make his armour save with a -1 modifier.
(Rare 9 for any Clan Skryre Skavens)

##### Nuln Shotgun

```
By Josh Alexander
The Nuln Shotgun is an experimental weapon that has yet to enter
general service. It is essentially a blunderbuss with a shorter, even
more flared barrel that has been modified to shoot premade
cartridges. What it lacks in range it makes up for in accuracy, and is
particularly useful in cramped city fighting.
Range: 12"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: Armour Piercing, Blast, Prepare Shot
Special Rules
Armour Piercing: Being a black powder weapon, the Nuln
Shotgun benefits from an additional -1 to the enemy’s armour
save.
Blast: The large spread of shot from the barrel makes it very
easy to hit nearby targets, but the blast quickly disperses. The
Nuln Shotgun ignores shooting penalties for cover and
movement, but suffers a –2 penalty for shooting at targets at
over half range.
Prepare Shot: The Nuln Shotgun must be reloaded after
firing, so may only be fired every other turn.

##### Pistol

A pistol is a small, simple Blackpowder weapon fired by a spring
mechanism. Most pistols are expensive, unreliable, and poorly
constructed.
Range: 6"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Prepare Shot, Save Modifier, Hand-to-Hand
Special Rules
Prepare Shot: A pistol takes a whole turn to reload, so you
may only fire every other turn. If you have a brace of pistols
(i.e., two) you may fire every turn.
Save Modifier: Pistols are even better at penetrating armour
than their Strength value of 4 suggests. A model wounded by
a pistol must take its armour save with a -2 modifier.
Hand-to-Hand: Pistols can be used in hand-to-hand combat
as well as for shooting. A model armed with a pistol and
another close combat weapon gains +1 Attack, which is
resolved at Strength 4 with a -2 save modifier. This bonus
attack can be used only once per combat. If you are firing a
brace of pistols, your model can fight with 2 Attacks in the
first turn of close combat. These attacks are resolved with a
model’s Weapon Skill like any normal close combat attack
and likewise may be parried. Successful hits are resolved at
Strength 4 and with a -2 save modifier, regardless of the
firer’s Strength.

##### Repeater Handgun

The next step in the evolution of multi-barrelled weapons, a
Repeater Handgun mounts a number of handgun barrels around a
rotating cylinder, each one firing in turn. Prone to misfiring or
other malfunction, Repeater Handguns are still highly sought after
items, as they will launch a veritable storm of lead at the enemy if
they don’t break down.
Range: 24"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Experimental, Fire Thrice, Move or Fire,
Save Modifier, Slow Reload,
Special Rules
Experimental: The Repeater Handgun is always subject to
the optional Blackpowder Weapons rules from the Mordheim
rulebook, even if they are not normally used in your
campaign. On any result other than “BOOM!” the weapon
has jammed or run out of loaded barrels and must be
reloaded.
Fire Thrice: The Repeater Handgun may fire up to three
shots; if more than one shot is made the to hit roll is at -1.
Resolve each shot individually, you may choose to shot later
shots at a different target, but they must be within 3" of the
previous target. Ordinary targeting restrictions apply to shots
as per Mordheim rulebook.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Repeater
Handgun in the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to
face your target or stand up from knocked down.
Save Modifier: Repeater Handguns are even better at
penetrating armour than their Strength value of 4 suggests. A
model wounded by a Repeater Handgun must take its armour
save with a -2 modifier.
Slow Reload: To reload a Repeater Handgun takes a long
time and a bit of focus. The warrior must do nothing (no
moving, no shooting, no fighting in close combat, etc.) for a
complete turn in order to reload the weapon.

##### Repeater Pistol

```
It wasn't long after the invention of the repeater handgun that the
same principle was being used on pistols. Still prone to misfiring or
other malfunction, they have found a place in gunnery bands
armouries. Stories of calm instructors gunning down hordes of foes
within feet of themselves are legendary and in all likelihood untrue.
But it just could happen....
Range: 6"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Experimental, Fire Thrice, Move or Fire,
Not a Club, Quick Reload, Save Modifier,
Special Rules
Experimental: The Repeater Pistol is always subject to the
optional Blackpowder Weapons rules from the Mordheim
rulebook, even if they are not normally used in your
campaign. On any result other than “BOOM!” the weapon
has jammed or run out of loaded barrels and must be
reloaded.
Fire Thrice: The Repeater Pistol may fire up to three shots;
if more than one shot is made the to hit roll is at - 1. Resolve
each shot individually, you may choose to shot later shots at a
different target, but they must be within 3" of the previous
target. Ordinary targeting restrictions apply to shots as per
Mordheim rulebook.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Repeater Pistol
in the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face your
target or stand up from knocked down.
Not a Club: The Repeater Pistol may be used as a normal
pistol in the first round of combat. After that it doesn't count
as an additional hand weapon as it is far too delicate to risk in
such a crude fashion. Its owner will not willingly discard it in
a fight and so must fight on without the use of an additional
hand weapon.
Quick Reload: The basic design of the pistol and number of
barrels allows quick reloading, the pistol will always be able
to fire at least one shot. After shooting more than one shot in
a single turn the model must spend a complete shooting phase
without shooting and without being in combat, before firing
multiple shots (see Fire Thrice, above) may be taken again.
Save Modifier: Repeater Pistols are even better at
penetrating armour than their Strength value of 4 suggests. A
model wounded by a Repeater Pistol must take its armour
save with a -2 modifier.
```
##### Rifle

```
Range: 36"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Move or Fire, Prepare Shot, Save Modifier,
SPECIAL RULE
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Rifle in the
same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face your target
or stand up from knocked down.
Prepare Shot: A rifle takes a whole turn to reload, so you
may only fire every other turn.
Save Modifier: Rifles are even better at penetrating armour
than their Strength value of 4 suggests. A model wounded by
a rifle must take its armour save with a -2 modifier.

##### Small Cannon

While the cannon can slow the warband down somewhat, it is
extremely useful against the larger creatures inhabiting the City of
the Damned.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Small Cannon * - - - 5 3 - - -

Range: 8" - 36"
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Hard to Fire, Large Target, Movement,
Save Modifier
Special Rules
Hard to Fire: Firing a Small Cannon requires a good crew, a
maintained weapon, and technical knowledge. The Small
Cannon can fire once every other turn with one crewman, and
each turn with two. All of the normal shooting rules apply,
but no Shooting skills apply to the Small Cannon. The
cannon may not move and fire in the same turn.
Large Target: Small Cannon is still an obvious target even
from far away, and can always be targeted by enemy
shooting.
Movement: Even the Small Cannon require a good crew to
move it. A single crewmember can move the Small Cannon
at haft his movement, two crewmembers can move it at their
full movement.
Save Modifier: Small Cannon are even better at penetrating
armour than their Strength 5 suggests. A warrior wounded by
a Small Cannon must make his armour save with a -3
modifier.
[Thanks to Josh Alexander for the idea].

##### Warpfire Thrower

The Warpfire thrower has an awesome potential to sends a jet of
liquid warpstone napalm that ignites in a searing magical flaming
conflagration. Since its magic is supported by mechanical means,
the net result is a blast more powerful than either could achieve
alone.
[Skaven, Clan Skryre Only]
Range: Special Attack (see below)
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Cumbersome, Heavy, Move or Fire, Pick
Target, Save Modifier, Special Attack,
Misfire
Special Rules
Cumbersome: Because the Warpfire Thrower is so heavy, a
model equipped with one may use no other weapons or
equipment.
Heavy: The Warpfire Thrower is a large heavy weapon and
at some times needed two to carry it. If used by only one then
the shooter has a -2 to movement, a -1 to Weapon Skill and
cannot charge. If the shooter(s) have to flee then they would
drop the Warpfire Thrower. The Warpfire Thrower counts as
being lost.
If the user has an Assistant, then there is only a -1 to
movement and Weapon Skill penalty.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Warpfire
Thrower in the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to
face your target or stand up from knocked down.

```
Pick Target: A model armed with a Warpfire Thrower can
target any enemy model in sight, not just the closest one.
Save Modifier: Warpfire Thrower are even better at
penetrating armour than their Strength 5 suggests. A warrior
wounded by a Warpfire Thrower must make his armour save
with a -2 modifier.
Special Attack: The Warpfire Thrower dose not fire like
other weapons been a volatile mixture of warpstone dust, oil,
& alcohol; firstly choose a target, place the Small Flame
Template at the base on the model towards the target, then
roll the Artillery Dice and moving the Small Flame Template
by the result (in inches) towards the Target. The Target and
any other model which the Small Flame Template passes
over is hit automatic and causing D3 Wounds.
Misfire: The Warpfire Thrower is always subject to the
optional Blackpowder Weapons rules, even if they are not
normally used in your campaign. On any result other than
“BOOM!” replace with the following:
Fireball: The Warpfire Thrower explodes into a
conflagration of bright green flames, the Weapon, User
(& Assistant) are destroyed, and any model within 2” of
the User, suffer a Strength 5 hit, causing D3 wound.
```
##### Warplock Pistol

```
Warplock pistols are terrifying weapons, testimony to the mad
genius of Clan Skryre engineers. Warplock pistols shoot ammunition
made of magically treated warpstone and wounds caused by
Warplock pistols are horrible to behold and often cause infections.
[Skaven Only]
Range: 8"
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Save -3, Fire Every Other Turn
Special Rules
Save -3: Victim suffers -3 to their Save roll.
Fire Every Other Turn: May be fired once every other turn.
Braces may be fired once every turn, or twice every other
turn.
```

#### Blackpowder Weapons Upgrades

##### Bayonet

Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Attachment, Strike First, Two-handed
Special Rules
Attachment: The Bayonet must be attached to a Handgun,
Rifle or Hunting Rifle. The weapon mounted with a Bayonet
acts like a Spear in close combat, but all Shooting attacks
have a -1 to hit while the Bayonet is attached. The weapon
can’t fire for the turn the Bayonet in attached.
Strike First: A warrior armed with a Bayonet strikes first in
the first turn of hand-to-hand combat.
Two-handed: A Bayonet requires two hands to be used and
the wielder cannot use a shield, buckler or additional weapon
in close combat.

##### Double-barrelled

Knowing Ostlanders’ penchant for impressive weaponry (and ready
willingness to spend excessive amounts of money) a Weaponsmith
from Hochland decided to weld two barrels together on a pistol and
sell it for twice the price. The Warband was so impressed with their
new weapon that they asked him to do the same to their hunting
rifle. Since then the Weaponsmith has been flooded with orders from
some of the most powerful Warbands in Mordheim.
Special Rules
A double-barrelled weapon is a tricky piece of engineering,
but it’s a wonderful piece for combat. When firing such a
weapon, the bearer must declare whether he is firing one or
both barrels. If firing a single barrel, treat the shot as you
would a normal weapon. However when firing both barrels,
the method changes slightly:
To hit: Roll a single dice as you would normally. This allows
for a narrow field of fire emanating from the weapon.
To wound: Roll for each shot individually, as each shot can
wound on its own. Treat each shot that inflicts Critical Hits
separately.
Reloading: After firing both barrels, place 2 tokens on the
model. In your next shooting phase remove 1 token to
represent one barrel having been reloaded. Token removal
should be the last thing done in your shooting phase and you
cannot shoot in the same phase as your reload.
Firing a Brace: If you fire both guns and barrels at the same
time, place 4 tokens down, 2 each of different colours (one
for each pistol in the brace). Remove one token of each
colour every turn.
Used On: This upgrade can only be used on Pistols, Duelling
Pistols, Handguns, Hochland long rifles, & Nuln Shotgun.

##### Heavier Ammunition

```
Heavier Ammunition is a special round; it may use Nickel or some
other heaver metal for the shot.
Heavier Ammunition increases the strength of one rifle shot
by 1. Heavy shot may only be used once.
```
##### Modified Gunsight

```
Gunsmiths are known for their innovative approach to battlefield
invention. A modified gunsight is simply the sight from a Hochland
Long rifle that has been altered to fit a standard handgun.
The result is a longer effective range due to the better aim. A
Modified Gunsight increases the maximum range of a
handgun to 30”. Note that this does not increase the
handgun’s short range, and that shooting at targets further
than 12” away will be subject to the usual –1 modifier.
```
##### Silver Bullets

```
Silver has always been rumoured to be the bane of evil creatures.
Gunsmiths are able to cast ammunition from silver, for use in any
black powder weapons (other than Blunderbuss or Nuln shotgun).
Firearms using silver bullets gain a +1 bonus to wound
undead and Possessed, Silver Bullets can be loaded into one
black powder weapon, and last for a single game.
```
##### Superior Blackpowder

```
The model has acquired a better quality of blackpowder than
is normally available. This new batch adds +1 Strength to all
blackpowder weapons that the model has. There is enough
superior blackpowder to last for one game.

#### Armour & Clothing

When fighting in close combat, a good suit of armour may mean the difference between life and death. The finest armour
in the known world is made in Dwarf forges, where the secrets of steel and fire are well understood. Hardened leather
jackets are often worn by the hunters of Osterland, while city soldiers prefer mail coats and steel breastplates. The forges of
the Empire have many skilled smiths capable of forging fine armour, for the humans learned this craft from Dwarf master
smiths in the early days of the Empire.
In Mordheim, only the most wealthy and powerful are able to afford the luxury of owning a suit of armour (the less well-off
have to make do with leather tunics and occasionally helmets and wooden shields). The richest leaders of the most
successful warbands wear suits of high quality armour and a good suit of armour is just as much a symbol of wealth and
power as it is protection against weapons.

##### Barding

Barding is armour for a horse in the same way that light and heavy
armour is for a human. It covers the mount’s hide and in some cases
the head.
[Warhorses Only]
Special Rules
A model mounted on barded horse receives an additional +1
Armour save (+2 instead of +1 for being mounted). In
addition, a mount wearing barding will only be killed on a D6
roll of a 1 if the model is taken out of action.

##### Bracers

Special Rules
Wearer may Parry. Does not occupy users hands. May be
used in conjunction with weapons that allow to parry but not
Bucklers or Shields.

##### Buckler

Bucklers are small, round shields designed for parrying or
deflecting blows. They are usually made of steel for they need to be
tremendously durable to survive the brutal blows of hand-to-hand
combat. Using a buckler requires great skill, but a nimble warrior
can protect himself from blows which would otherwise cripple him.
Special Rules
Parry: A model equipped with a buckler may parry the first
blow in each round of hand-to-hand combat. When his
opponent scores a hit, a model with a buckler may roll 1D6.
If the score is greater than the highest to hit score of his
opponent, the model has parried the blow, and that attack is
discarded. A model may not parry attacks made with double
or more its own Strength – they are simply too powerful to be
stopped.

##### Cathayan Silk Clothes

Some rich warband leaders like to flaunt their wealth and purchase
clothes made out of silk from distant Cathay. This silk is the most
expensive fabric in the known world, and wearing such clothes is a
sure way to attract attention – especially thieves and assassins!
Any Mercenary warband whose leader is wearing silk clothes
may re-roll the first failed Rout test. However, after each
battle in which the leader is taken out of action, roll a D6. On
a roll of 1-3 the clothes are ruined and must be discarded.

##### Cold Metal Armour

```
Wood Elves do not use forges; they have a special smithing style
known by outsides as “Cold Forging”. Cold Forging is a mix of
both physical and magical techniques known only to the Wood
Elves. The Metal which comes from this Cold Forging technique is
call Cold Metal.
Special Rules
Save: Cold Metal Armour gives the wearer a 5+ basic save,
and does not slow him down if he is also armed with a shield.
The Cold Metal Armour is so light and strong that other
armour giving the wear has more movement. Cold Metal
Armour gives the wear a -1 to hit in Close Combat.
```
##### Dark Steel Armour

```
Dark Steel armour like Dark Steel Weapons are forged in the city of
Hag Graef, the Dark Crag. They are fashioned from Black steel, a
rare form of steel found deep within the mountains around the city.
Special Rules
Save: Dark Steel armour gives the wearer a 5+ basic save,
and does not slow him down if he is also armed with a shield.
The Dark Steel Armour is stronger that other armour, Dark
Steel Armour gives the wear a -1 to wound in Close Combat.
```
##### Elven Cloak

```
Made from the hair of Elven maidens and interwoven with living
tree leaves, an Elven cloak is a wonder to behold. A warrior
wearing such a cloak will blend into the shadows, making it very
difficult to shoot at them with missile weapons. Elven cloaks rarely
come up for sale, but are sometimes recovered from dead warriors
or offered by Elves as rewards to men who have served them in
some way.
A warrior aiming a missile weapon at a warrior wearing an
Elven cloak suffers -1 on his to hit roll.
Being from Ulthuan, Shadow Warriors have access to items
that are rarely seen by other races; 75 + D6x10 GC;
Availability: Rare 12
```
Assembled By Paul H Page 33 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


##### Forest Cloak

[Outlaw Heroes and Wood Elves only]
Some Outlaws use Forest Cloaks to camouflage themselves
against being seen by their enemies. Any wearer of such a
cloak would appear to blend into the surrounding forest
making it almost impossible to be seen. So long as the wearer
is beside a tree, bush, hedge or vegetation, any enemy using
any kind of missile weapon at a warrior wearing a Forest
Cloak is at an additional -1 BS to hit (in addition to all other
modifiers). Similarly, if any spellcaster wishes to target a
magical attack against an Outlaw camouflaged in this way, he
can only do so by successfully rolling a 4+ on a D6. The only
exception to this is if the shooting warrior or the spellcaster is
already within their Initiative range in inches. Forest Cloaks
are available to Heroes at the time of their initial recruitment
without having to roll for Rarity. If you wish to subsequently
purchase this item during the Trading and Exploration stages
of the game, then you would have to roll for Rarity as
normal.

##### Gromril Armour

Gromril is the rarest and strongest metal known of in the Old
World. Only a very few Dwarf smiths know the secret of forging
Gromril, and a suit of armour made from it fetches a huge price.
Special Rules
Save: Gromril armour gives the wearer a 4+ basic save, and
does not slow him down if he is also armed with a shield.

##### Heavy Armour

Typical heavy armour is made from metal links and is called chain
mail. Forging chain mail is a laborious and time consuming
process, as the blacksmith must put together hundreds, sometimes
thousands, of metal links. This makes chain mail expensive, but this
type of armour provides excellent protection for anyone who can
afford it.
There are other types of heavy armour as well, of which the best
known are the steel breastplates and greaves worn by the foot
knights of the Templar orders.
Special Rules
Save: A warrior that is wearing heavy armour has a basic D6
saving throw of 5+.
Movement: A warrior that is armed with both heavy armour
and a shield suffers a -1 Movement penalty.

##### Helmet

From the shining steel helmets of Bretonnian knights to the
leather caps of the Skaven, all sensible warriors try to protect
the most vulnerable part of their body – their head. Even the
most vain fighters still use a helmet, as it can be festooned
with plumes, horns and other decorations. Helmets come in
varying shapes and sizes, but their basic function remains the
same.
Special Rules
Avoid Stun: A model that is equipped with a helmet has a
special 4+ save on a D6 against being stunned. If the save is
made, treat the stunned result as knocked down instead. This
save is not modified by the opponent’s Strength.

##### Ithilmar Armour

```
Ithilmar is a silvery metal which is as light as silk and stronger than
steel. Elves are experts at fashioning weapons and armour from
Ithilmar, and the Elven kingdom of Caledor is the only place in the
world where this metal can be found.
Special Rules
Save: Ithilmar armour gives the wearer a 5+ basic save, and
does not slow him down if he is also armed with a shield.
```
##### Light Armour

```
Light armour encompasses a wide variety of materials from
hardened leather tunics to chain shirts forged from steel. It does not
offer complete protection against arrows or swords, but it is better
than having nothing at all. Light armour does not inhibit movement.
Special Rules
Save: A warrior who is wearing light armour has a basic D6
saving throw of 6.
```
##### Pavise

```
A pavise is a huge shield commonly used by regiments of
warriors in a battle to defend themselves from the arrows of
their enemies. It is a weighty item and little use in a long
protracted combat but excellent against shooting.
Special Rules
Cover/Save: A warrior using a pavise counts as if he is in
cover against missile attacks (-1 to hit). In close combat, the
pavise counts as a shield (+1 armour save) but only if the
warrior was charged to his front. Because the pavise is so
heavy and cumbersome, the bearer moves at half pace.
```
##### Reinforced Plate Armour

```
By Josh Alexander
Reinforced Plate is a new type of armour manufactured in the
Gunnery School of Nuln. It is based on an ordinary suit of Heavy
Armour, but has additional plating covering the joints and chest
plate to add resistance against firearms.
Special Rules
Save: Reinforced Plate Armour gives the wearer a 5+ armour
save. In addition, the extra plates negate Armour Piercing
ability of black powder weapons, meaning S4 black powder
weapons will only have a –1 armour save penalty.
Cumbersome: The heavy plating restricts movement and
reaction time, reducing the Initiative of the wearer by one.
When Reinforced Plate Armour is combined with a shield, it
reduces the movement of the wearer by 1”, exactly like heavy
armour.
```
##### Sea Dragon Cloak

```
Dark Elf Corsairs use special cloaks fashioned from Sea Monsters
that dwell deep in the oceans depths. These cloaks are tough and
resilient and offer Dark Elves with a very good amount of
protection.
[Dark Elves Only]
Special Rules
Scales: the model wearing a Sea Dragon Cloak will gain +2
to his armour saves in close combat and a 4+ armour save
against all missiles attacks.
```

##### Shield

There are two types of shield common to the warriors of Mordheim:
the first is made of wood, occasionally reinforced with metal plates.
This basic type of shield, although strong, does tend to splinter, but
this can sometimes save the user’s life as his enemy’s weapon can
get trapped allowing him to strike back whilst his enemy struggles to
free his weapon.
Metal shields are heavy and cumbersome, but last much longer and
can take a battering. A typical Empire shield is either round or
triangular, and carries the emblem of the province or city of its
owner.
Special Rules
Save: A model with a shield has a basic save of 6 on a D6.

##### Toughened Leathers

Expert leatherworkers are able to turn leather coats into armour
(after a fashion) and those with limited funds often favour these
jackets and coats as armour is very expensive. Covered with crusted
salt, alcohol and other less savoury materials, toughened leather is
hard to penetrate and offers some protection in combat.
Special Rules
Toughened leathers work exactly like light armour, giving the
wearer a 6+ Armour save, but cannot be combined with the
effects of any other armour except a helmet or buckler.
Toughened leathers cannot be sold back at the Trading Posts;
the stench alone is enough to drive away even the most

## desperate of buyers!

##### Wolfcloak

```
In Middenheim it is still considered to be the feat of a true man to
slay a great wolf single-handed. Warriors who accomplish such a
deed will command the respect of their peers, and their cloaks will
be blessed by the High Priest of the Cult of Ulric, the god of winter,
war and wolves.
[Middenheimers Only]
Special Rules
To acquire a Wolfcloak, a Hero must pay 10 GC (to represent
the expense of travelling to Middenheim and taking part in a
hunt). In addition, the Hero must roll equal to or under his
Strength on a D6. If successful, the Hero finds and slays the
wolf and can wear its cloak as a mark of his skill and
prowess. Note that Middenheimers may buy Wolfcloaks
when starting their warband without making a test for
availability. A model wearing a Wolfcloak will gain +1 to his
armour saves against all shooting attacks.
```

### Miscellaneous equipment

This section covers all the strange and unusual equipment your warriors can find in the ruins or buy from the
merchants and pedlars in the settlements and villages around Mordheim.
Only Heroes may buy and carry the equipment described in this section. You may not give it to Henchmen unless the
rules specifically say so.

#### Alcohol, Drugs, Poisons & Potions

The use of poison is almost universally abhorred, but in the ruthless and brutal battles fought in Mordheim, desperate warbands often resort
to the use of envenomed blades.
Poison may not be used with blackpowder weapons. When you buy a vial of poison, there is always only enough to last the duration of one
battle. You can only poison a single weapon with one vial of poison.

##### Black Lotus

In the deepest forests of the Southlands grows a plant that is
extremely poisonous. It is known as Black Lotus and is much sought
after by alchemists, assassins, wizards of the Western Coast and
bored wives.
[Not available to Witch Hunters, Warrior-Priests or Sisters of
Sigmar]
[Rare 7 for Skaven]
A weapon coated with the sap of the Black Lotus will wound
its target automatically if you roll a 6 to hit. Note that you can
still roll a dice for every wound inflicted in this way. If you
roll a 6, you will inflict a critical hit with that roll. If you do
not roll a 6, you will cause a normal wound. Take armour
saves as normal.

##### Blessed Water

The priests of Ulric, Sigmar, Morr and Manann hold great power
over evil. Pure water from a clear fountain, blessed by one of these
priests, is said to burn things of darkness and evil.
[May not be bought by Undead]
[Common for Warrior-Priests & Sisters of Sigmar]
A vial of blessed water contains enough liquid for just one
use, and has a thrown range of twice the thrower’s Strength
in inches. Roll to hit using the model’s BS. No modifiers for
range or moving apply. Blessed water causes 1 wound on
Undead, Daemon or Possessed models automatically. There
is no armour save. Undead or Possessed models may not use
blessed water.

##### Bugman’s Ale

Of all the Dwarf brewmasters, Josef Bugman is the most famous.
His ale is known throughout the Old World, and widely regarded as
the best.
A warband that drinks a barrel of Bugman’s before a battle
will be immune to fear for the whole of the battle. Elves may
not drink Bugman’s ale as they are far too delicate to cope
with its effects. There is only enough ale to supply the
warband for one battle.

##### Crimson Shade

Crimson Shade is the name given by Old Worlders to the
leaves of the blood oak of Estalia. It is an extremely addictive
drug, but grants its users inhuman quickness and strength.
Effect: A model using Crimson Shade has his Initiative
increased by +D3 points, and Movement and Strength by +1
(this effect lasts for one game). Crimson Shade has no effect
on Undead such as Vampires and Zombies, or the Possessed.
Side Effects: After the battle, roll 2D6. On a roll of 2-3, the
model becomes addicted and you must try to buy him a new
batch of Crimson Shade before every battle from now on. If
you fail to buy any, he will leave your warband. On a roll of
12 the model’s Initiative is increased permanently by +1.

##### Dark Venom

```
This is a poison extracted from Heldrakes, gigantic sea serpents that
plague the Western Ocean and the coast of Naggaroth. The slightest
wound infected by Dark Venom causes excruciating pain,
incapacitating the bravest of men.
[Not available to Witch Hunters, Warrior-Priests, or Sisters
of Sigmar]
Any hit caused by a weapon coated with Dark Venom counts
as having +1 Strength, so, for example, if a warrior with
Strength 3 wielding a poisoned sword hits an opponent, he
will cause a Strength 4 hit instead. Armour saving throws are
modified to take into account the increased Strength of the
attack.
```
##### Elven Wine

```
[Shadow Warriors Only, one use only]
High Elven wines are well known to be the best in the world,
and some are even rumoured to have magical qualities. A fine
Elven Wine can cast out doubt and fear and leave a general
feeling of well-being in a warrior. A Shadow Warrior
Warband that drinks Elven Wine before a battle will be
immune to Fear for the whole of the battle.
```
##### Garlic

```
[May not be bought by Undead]
Garlic is a common herb grown in most gardens of the
Empire. It is said to ward off Vampires and other denizens of
the dark. A Vampire must pass a Leadership test or it will be
unable to charge a model carrying a clove of garlic. Garlic
lasts for the duration of one battle only, whether it is used or
not.
```
##### Healing Herbs

```
Certain plants that grow on the banks of the River Stir have
curative properties. Herbalists collect their roots and leaves
and use them to treat the sick and wounded. A Hero with
healing herbs can use them at the beginning of any of his
recovery phases as long as he is not engaged in hand-to-hand
combat. This restores all wounds he has previously lost
during the game. Amazon Warriors are master herbalists and
may buy Healing Herbs as common items, instead of rare
items, for 35 GC.
```
##### Healing Potion

```
May be used during the battle or after
● Effect - During Game: Restore 1 lost wound
● Effect - After Game: Model ignores all results on Serious
injury Chart except for Dead, Captured or Full Recovery.
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 36 Assembled by Paul H


##### Liquor Flask

May be used in the recovery phase. If used, owner is immune
to fear until his next recovery phase. Two uses each game,
refilled for 5 gold crowns. Available to any hero who can use
equipment, doesn't work on any hero immune to poison.

##### Mad Cap Mushrooms

The feared cult of Goblin Fanatics of the Worlds Edge
Mountains use these hallucinogenic mushrooms to drive
themselves into a frenzied state.
● Effect: Any warrior who takes Mad Cap Mushrooms before
a battle will be subject to frenzy. The Mad Cap Mushroom
has no effect on Undead such as Vampires and Zombies, or
the Possessed.
● Side Effect: After the battle, roll a D6. On a roll of a 1 the
model becomes permanently stupid.
● Orcs & Goblins Hordes: May consider them a common
item that cost 25 gold crowns if it includes one or more
Goblins, as they are a necessity for someone wishing to wield
a ball and chain. Fortunately for Orc warbands, Mad Cap
Mushrooms are cultivated by the Night Goblins of the
Worlds Edge Mountains, and they are much more willing to
trade these to other Goblins. A Goblin may take his
mushrooms at the start of any turn.

##### Mandrake Root

The man-shaped Mandrake Root grows in the rotting swamps
of Sylvania. It is a noxious, deadly plant which is highly
addictive and slowly kills its users, but also allows them to
shrug off almost any pain.
● Effect: Mandrake Root makes a man almost oblivious to
pain. His Toughness is increased by +1 for the duration of a
battle and he treats all stunned results as knocked down
instead. Mandrake Root has no effect on Undead, such as
Vampires and Zombies, or on the Possessed.
● Side Effects: Mandrake Root is highly poisonous. At the
end of the battle, roll 2D6. On a roll of 2-3 the model loses 1
point of Toughness permanently.

##### Potion of Strength

● Effect: The Potion adds +D3 to strength
● Duration: A leadership test recovery phase to see if the
Potion’s effects wear off.

##### Speed Potion

On the Turn the potion is taken roll to find out what happens:
D6 Result

1 unaffected
2 - 3 M and I increase by D3
4 - 5 I and M increase by 3, but T is at -1
6 I and WS increase by D6, BS and M by D3
● Duration: Roll a D6 each recovery phase, if equal to or less
then the Toughness the effects last for another turn, when the
Potion wears off he goes down for a turn, after that treat as
normal.

##### Spider’s Poison

Forest Goblins commonly jab their weapon points into the
bodies of giant spiders in hopes of coating them with deadly
poison. Once this poison is bought, it is applied to one
weapon, and may not be traded or sold later on. The weapon

```
in question, once poisoned, adds +1 to any injury rolls from
then on.
● Common: Forest Goblins may consider Spider’s Poison as
a common item that cost 25 gold crowns.
```
##### Tears of Shallaya

```
[Not available to Possessed or Undead.]
Tears of Shallaya are vials of water from the holy spring in
Couronne. Shallaya is the goddess of healing and mercy and
it is said that this water has curative properties and is proof
against any poison. A model who drinks a vial of the Tears of
Shallaya at the beginning of a battle will be completely
immune to all poisons for the duration of combat. Undead
and Possessed warriors may not use the Tears of Shallaya.
There is enough liquid in a vial of the Tears of Shallaya to
last for the duration of one battle.
```
##### Vial of Pestilens

```
This small crystal vial contains an extremely potent and rapid
disease. A single sniff is enough to melt the airways and leave the
victim drowning in its own blood. It is, however, short lived and
only remains dangerous for a few seconds before it is neutralised in
the air.
[Skaven only]
The vial may be opened and shoved in the face of the model
in base contact that just took the Skaven Out of Action. The
opponent must roll equal to or under its Toughness or
automatically be taken Out of Action, no save is allowed. If
the opponent succumbs to the disease, he didn’t manage to go
through with the attack and the Skaven is only Stunned not
Out of Action. The vial may be used once.
```
##### Vodka

```
[Kislevite Heroes Only]
Kislevites live in a harsh land under constant threat of
invasion. While this has instilled a seriousness in these
people, it has not diluted their love of celebration one bit. If
anything their love of revelry has increased with the
hardships they have had to endure, as they have learned that
life is fleeting, and any excuse to enjoy what they have been
given is not to be squandered. One of the products of this
love of life and celebration is a strong alcoholic spirit called
vodka. It is also one of the country’s most famous exports,
though most inhabitants of the Old World find it too harsh for
their palates. Kislevites take such enjoyment in this drink and
regard it as something almost magical. Mothers give vodka to
their families to ward off sickness and to keep them warm in
the long winter months and warriors indulge both for luck
and courage. Outsiders often scoff at the reputed properties of
this liquor, but it must be said that a Kislevite army that is
well supplied with vodka certainly fights better and in higher
spirits than one without. In game terms, vodka is a one-use
item of equipment that a Kislevite Hero may give to the
warband before the start of the game. Every warrior in the
warband receives +1 Leadership (up to a maximum of 10) for
that game. In addition because of its nullifying alcoholic
effects every warband member must test against their
Toughness before the start of the game – a failure resulting in
-1 Initiative for the duration of the game.
```

#### Banners

##### Banner

Many more established warbands carry a banner or flag, not only to
announce their presence but to also act as a rallying point for the
warband during a battle.
A banner requires one hand to use and can be carried by any
Hero in the warband. Friendly warriors within 12" of the
banner bearer may re-roll any failed ‘All-Alone’ test; but
remember you can’t re-roll a failed re-roll.

##### Clan Pestilens Banner

[Skaven, Clan Pestilens Only]
A model within 12'' of the standard bearer of the band,
usually a Plague Monk or a Monk Initiate, may reroll once
every failed All Alone test. The staff of the Clan Pestilens
banner counts as a two-handed weapon. A warband may have
a single Clan Pestilens banner at any one time. (Clan
Pestilens members use this item instead of the normal
Banner).

##### Standard of Nagarythe

```
[Shadow Warriors Only]
May only be purchased when the warband is created. While
many Shadow Warrior Warbands are simply wandering,
some represent groups that have been sent from Ulthuan on
some special mission for the Phoenix King. Such bands are
really closer to military units than loose bands of warriors. As
such, they tend to retain their unit insignia and other
trappings. Chief among these is the unit standard. A unit’s
colours can hold a lot of meaning, particularly when the
warriors in that unit lack a true home. A Shadow Warrior
band normally makes their standard by hand; cost and rarity
represent the difficulty of finding the proper materials (fine
silks and thread of gold, for example). A Standard of
Nagarythe can serve as a second rallying point (the Shadow
Master is the first, represented by his Leader skill) for the
unit. Any members of the Shadow Warrior Warband within
6" of their standard take all Leadership tests against a
Leadership value of 10. In addition, should the standard be
captured by the enemy (model holding the standard is Taken
Out of Action), all members of the Warband will be subject
to Frenzy for the remainder of the game, and may not
voluntarily Rout. Note that these effects (Leadership 10 and
Frenzy) do not affect any Hired Swords in the Warband, only
actual Shadow Warriors (including Shadow Warrior heroes)
are affected. A model carrying a standard requires one hand
free to do so, so no weapons, shields, etc. may be carried in
this hand, and no double-handed weapons may be used while
the standard is carried. A standard may be used in close
combat as a makeshift spear (use the rules for a spear but
with -1 on the to hit rolls.)
```
#### Charms & Amulets

##### Bear-Claw Necklace

Bears are widely regarded as sacred in Kislev, and a necklace made
of their claws (or sometimes their teeth) is considered magical and
reputed to have magical powers.
[Kislevite Heroes Only]
A warrior wearing a bear-claw necklace receives some of the
strength and wild ferocity of the bear it came from. A warrior
wearing a bear-claw necklace becomes subject to Frenzy.

##### Lucky Charm

These take many shapes, but the most common are symbolic
hammers that a pious Sigmarite Priest has touched, or carved
heads of ancient Dwarf gods. The first time a model with a
lucky charm is hit in a battle they roll a D6. On a 4+ the hit is
discarded and no damage is suffered. Owning two or more
charms does not confer any extra benefits, the model may
still only try to discard the first hit.

##### Rabbit's Foot

The rabbit's foot is a symbol of good luck and often worn
about the neck on a thin cord of leather by superstitious
warriors. A rabbit's foot allows the warrior wearing it to re-
roll one dice during the battle. If not used in the battle, it can
be used to re-roll one dice during the Exploration phase,
providing the hero is able to search through the ruins.

##### Red Toof Tribal Jewellery

```
(Greenskins Only)
Only proving one’s prowess in battle can attract the attention
of this cadre of warriors. Once inducted to the tribe, the
warrior undertakes excessive body piercing! This cannot be
removed. The model will now be subject to the rules for
Frenzy as described in the rulebook.
```
##### Tarot Cards

```
[Not available to Witch Hunters or Sisters of Sigmar]
Though declared blasphemous and illegal by the Grand
Theogonist, the Tarot of Stars is said to foretell the future for
those who dare to consult it.
SPECIAL RULE
A Hero with a deck of tarot cards may consult them before
each game. Make a Leadership test. If successful, the Hero
gains a favourable insight into the future and you may modify
the result of any one dice in the Exploration phase by -1/+1
(even if the Hero with the cards is taken Out Of Action). If
the Leadership test is failed by three or more (i.e., a Hero
with Ld of 8 rolls 11 or 12) the cards show a portent of doom
and despair and the Hero refuses to fight in the following
battle and must miss the next game.
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 38 Assembled by Paul H


##### Warpstone Amulet

[Skaven Heroes Only]
The owner of a warpstone amulet may reroll a single die
during the battle or, if not out of combat at the end of the
game, a single die when looking for wyrdstone shards.

##### Wyrdstone Pendulum

```
Pendulums made of wyrdstone can reputedly be used to find
even more of the magical stone.
Special Rules
If he was not taken out, the Hero using the Wyrdstone
Pendulum may make a Leadership test after the battle. If he is
successful, you may re-roll any one dice in the Exploration
phase.
```
#### Encampment Equipment

##### Barricade

A warrior defending a barricade can only be hit by his
opponent on an unmodified D6 score of 6. Each section is 6"
long and 1" high.

##### Ditch

It counts as difficult terrain, reducing movement by half.
Each section is 6" long and 1" deep.

##### Heads on spikes

These cause Fear and may be attached to barricades or
palisades (the enemy must pass a Leadership test if they wish
to assault them)

##### Kennel

All War hounds get a +1 to their WS and a +1 to their
leadership.
Beast handler: To setup the Kennel at the encampment you must
first hirer a Dog Handler (Beast handler) to train your War hounds
first.
Upkeep: The Kennel requires constant repairs; to show this the
Kennel has an upkeep of 5 GC per battle.

##### Ladders

These are useful for assaulting another warband’s
encampment and negate the effects of barricades and
palisades

##### Palisade

A warrior defending a palisade can only be hit by his
opponent on an unmodified D6 score of 6. Each section is 6"
long and 2" high.

##### Scout Tower

This gives the defender a high platform to shoot from (this
may be as tall as 8"). The scout towers are usually made from
wood and so are flammable and Counts as light cover (-1).
Upkeep: The Scout Tower require constant repairs; to show this the
Scout Tower has an upkeep of 5 GC per battle, also to repair any
fire damage will increase the upkeep by D6, for each time.

##### Stable

All horse and war-horse get a +1 to their WS and a +1 to their
leadership, including the war-horse of a freelance Knight.
Beast handler: To setup the Stable at the encampment you must
first hirer a Horse Master (Beast handler) to train your Horses / War
horses first.
Upkeep: The Stable require constant repairs; to show this the Stable
has an upkeep of 5 GC per horse plus 10 GC per War horse per
battle.

##### Stakes

It counts as difficult terrain, reducing movement by half. In
addition, those attempting to cross must roll a D6 – on a 5+
the warrior takes a Strength 3 hit with no armour saves
allowed. Each section is 6" long.

##### Tents

```
Those that travel require shelter from the freezing nights and
often-fierce wind and rain. The tent can offer protection from
the elements. The tent normally has one entrance and can
sleep up to six models. Because of the tent’s narrow entrance,
it is unusual for more than one model to be able to shoot from
the tent or fight in hand-to-hand combat (depending on your
model tent).
Damaging Tents: Tents are made of a tough, hard wearing material
but can be slashed and cut open using natural claws, a dagger or
other bladed weapon (but not a hammer, dogs’ paws, etc). In game
terms they have a Toughness of 2, 4 Wounds and count as
flammable.
If a sharp weapon causes a ‘wound’, a hole has been opened. Place a
marker to indicate where this improvised opening is. However, a
successful Initiative test must be made to enter, otherwise the
warrior has become tangled in the tent’s fabric and can do nothing
else this turn. A warrior, thus entangled, may be attacked from
inside or outside the tent, and the entangled warrior is at half WS
when defending himself. If reduced to 0 Wounds, the tent collapses.
All inside must make a successful Initiative test to free themselves.
They may do nothing else until freed, nor may they be attacked.
Tent Models: The tent models should be made with one entrance
and so that no more than six models (20mm bases) can fit inside.
They can be round or rectangular (rectangular is easier for game
play) – both are appropriate for the setting. Make the tents such that
the canvas can be lifted off to leave a floor area with some wall
(about an inch or so) so that the entrance is clearly marked.
```
##### Tunnels

```
These allow one Henchmen group to be held in reserve at the
start of the game and may be placed anywhere on the
battlefield at the start of the defender’s turn but no closer than
within 8" of an enemy model, however model moving
through a tunnel must roll a D6 on a 1 the Tunnel has
collapsed in, the model now counts as been taken Out of
Action.
Upkeep: The tunnels require constant repairs; to show this the
tunnels has an upkeep of 10 GC per battle.
```
##### Traps

```
The defender may place up to three trap markers (per trap if
you have more than one) anywhere within their encampment.
Each marker is marked with either ‘Trap’ or ‘Decoy’ on the
underside. When a model touches the marker, flip it over. If it
says ‘Decoy’, nothing happens. If it says ‘Trap’ then that
model takes a Strength 4 hit with no armour save
```
##### Watchtower

```
This gives the defender a high platform to shoot from (this
may be as tall as 8") The Watchtower are usually made from
stone Counts as hard cover (-2).
Upkeep: The Watchtower requires constant repairs; to show this the
Watchtower has an upkeep of 15 GC per battle.
```

#### Equipment from Khemri

##### Bota Bag

Like a wine skin it allows the owner to carry one more water
unit than normal. Each character may only take one Bota
Bag.

##### Lamp of the Djinn

These are exceptionally rare items that date back to the time of the
Sultan Jaffar. It was said that the Sultan used magic and dark ritual
to bind strange daemonic entities to mundane, everyday items so
that he could call upon their powers but hide their true identity.
Occasionally, one of these items finds its way into the hands of those
foolhardy or reckless enough to try to use the powers of the dread
Djinn.
Each time a hero uses the lamp it grants him three wishes but
each time you roll on the ‘Light table’ you must roll on the
‘Dark table’ and apply the results.
D6 Light
1 Gain D6 Experience points
2 Gain one skill from your skill list
3 Gain D6x10 GC
4 Gain a random item from the equipment list
5 Choose an item from the equipment list
6 Roll twice more on this chart

D6 Dark
1 Nothing happens
2 Nothing happens
3 Lose D6x10 GC
4 Lose D6 weapons
5 Lose the lamp
6 Roll once on the injury chart

##### Magic Carpet

These wondrous items from a forgotten age are even rarer than the
lamps of the Djinn and are thought to have originated from the
distant long dead Sorcerer’s Isles.
A magic carpet is indeed just that – a carpet that flies! It
counts as a mount and allows movement of 16" with no
restrictions for terrain. You can move onto the roofs of
buildings and other high places with no penalty. The carpet
may carry up to three men or one large creature and a man.
One of the riders must be a character. Due to its magical
nature it cannot be destroyed.

##### Magic Gourd

The power of the gourd may be used at the end of each battle.
It will supply 1D3 units of water. Once the amount of water
is determined, roll an additional D6 – on a roll of 6, the
gourd’s magic is exhausted and it shatters.

##### Monkey’s paw

Fashioned during the strange religious rites of the nomadic Tuareg
people, this item is of similar potency to the Lamp of the Djinn. As
with the fickle powers of the Djinn the, Monkey’s paw is not always
beneficial to its owner.
Each time a Hero uses the paw it grants three wishes but you
only have to roll once on the dark side. If you roll this item
you must take it. Every two games you have it and don’t use
it you have to roll on the dark side. You may not get rid of

```
the paw unless you use it three times or roll lose the paw.
After the third use it disappears.
D6 Light
1 Gain D6 Experience points
2 Gain one skill from your Skill list
3 Gain D6x10 GC
4 Gain an extra Hero even if it is above your maximum
allowed
5 Gain an extra Henchman even if it is above your
maximum allowed
6 Roll twice more on this chart
```
```
D6 Dark
1 Lose D6 Experience points
2 Lose one random skill
3 Lose D6x10 GC
4 Lose a Hero
5 Lose a Henchman
6 Lose the paw
```
##### Nehekharan Map

```
Maps of the Land of the Dead are rare. Accurate ones are even
rarer. The shifting sands and dry riverbeds can render a map
obsolete in a season.
Use the rules for the Mordheim map in the rulebook.
```
##### Nomad Robes

```
Woven by native desert dwellers these robes enable the wearer to
suffer only half penalties from Weather Conditions.
The robes affect the following results on the Weather table:
It’s Raining: The robe protects the warrior’s equipment.
When rolling a D6 each time that you fire a black powder
weapon, the shot is only wasted on a 1.
Hot as Hades: A warrior wearing a Nomad Robe only
suffers a penalty of -1 to WS and BS and he only requires the
normal amount of water.
Hot: A warrior wearing a Nomad Robe suffers no penalty to
WS or BS. If at least half of the warband are wearing Nomad
Robes, they only require the normal amount of water.
Dust Storm: The robe has no effect – not even the Nomad
Robes can protect the warrior from the ferocity of the storm.
Apply rules for a Dust Storm as normal.
```
##### Scorpion Ring

```
At the beginning of the battle the warrior is able to call forth
a single Tomb Scorpion to fight for the warband if he can
pass a Leadership test. The summoned scorpion will fight for
a single battle only (use Tomb Scorpion from Tomb
Guardians list).
```
##### Snake Charmer’s Flute

```
A warrior who possesses this item is able to transfix and
control serpents. If the warrior does nothing for a whole turn,
he may play the flute. If this happens, any serpent within 6"
may not move or attack in their subsequent turn.
```
##### Venom Ring

```
The Venom Ring renders the wearer immune to the effects of
all poisons.
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 40 Assembled by Paul H


#### Equipment from Lustria

##### Amulet of the Moon

Once activated, this ancient device creates a shimmering aura
around the wearer that makes it harder for enemies to see them.
Any missile fire directed at a model equipped with the amulet
suffers a penalty of -1 to hit. The amulet also confers a
special save of 5+ against missile fire.

##### Cloak of Mists

Only a Hero can have this item. There is an additional -1
penalty to hit for any attacks against the wearer (close combat
or missile fire). There is also a -1 penalty to Initiative when
trying to spot the wearer if he is Hidden.

##### Enchanted Skins

```
The protective skins and charms that the Amazons wear have
been warded with defensive magic. To represent this, any
model wearing Skins and Charms receives a 6+ special save
versus any wounds inflicted. In addition, the wearer of Skins
and Charms is unaffected by enemy magic on a roll of 5+.
```
##### Conch Shell Horn

```
The Conch shell Horn is used by experienced Piranha warriors to
warn the warband of approaching enemies.
[Piranha warriors only]
At the beginning of the game a Piranha warrior may use the
horn to re-roll when deciding who deploys first and who goes
first. Multiple models that have the horn cannot force a
second re-roll.
```
#### Magic, Books & Scrolls

##### Book of the Dead

This is a book that contains transcripts from the Famous
books of Nagash, the Great Necromancer. A Model can learn
Necromantic Magic with Arcane Lore skill and this book. A
Necromancer will gain a new spell permanently.

##### Dispel Scroll

This scroll contains a powerful counter-spell. It may be read
aloud immediately after an opponent has successfully cast a
spell (but before results have been determined) to negate its
effects. When used roll a D6. The enemy spell is cancelled on
a roll of 4 or more. After one use, the scroll will disintegrate
and is useless.

##### Elven Runestones

[Shadow Weavers Only]
High Elven mages are well known as the masters of
defensive magic. To aid them, they have developed several
mystic runes of power. They often inscribe these runes on
semiprecious stones, which can help strengthen an Elven
Mage’s magical defences. A mage with Elven Runestones
may use them to attempt to dispel a spell that has been
successfully cast against himself or another member of his
warband. To dispel such a spell, the mage must roll against
the spell’s Difficulty (Sorcery does not help here). If he
succeeds, the spell fails to work. If the roll fails, the spell
works normally.

##### Halfling Cookbook

All Halfling chefs have their own secret recipes, and these are
recorded in tomes handwritten in Mootland, the home country of the
Halflings. Food prepared according to these recipes will attract
warriors during these lean times.
The maximum number of warriors allowed in your warband
is increased by +1 (note that neither an Undead warband nor
a Carnival of Chaos warband can use this item).

##### Hammer of Witches

[Witch Hunters Only]
The pages in this tome describe the servants of Chaos, witches,
heretics, deviants, mutants, warlocks, blasphemers, necromancers,
sinners and other enemies of Sigmar in all their foulness.
Special Rules

```
A Hero with the Hammer of Witches will hate all Possessed,
Skaven, Beastmen, Chaos, Daemons, Dark Elf, Orc &
Goblins and Sigmarite Sisters.
```
##### Holy (Unholy) Relic

```
In this age of superstition and religious fanaticism, holy objects are
an important part of life. Relics abound in the Old World: hairs of
Sigmar, pieces from Ulric’s hammer, teeth of Daemon Princes, all
are sold to men needing encouragement before battle and as charms
against sorcery.
[Rare 6 for warrior-priests and Sisters of Sigmar]
A model with a holy relic will automatically pass the first
Leadership test he is required to make in the game. If worn
by the leader, it will allow him to automatically pass the first
Rout test if he has not taken any Leadership tests before.
You can only ignore the first Leadership test in any single
game – owning two or more holy relics will not allow you to
ignore second and subsequent tests.
```
##### Holy Tome

```
Books of prayers and descriptions of the holy deeds of religious
heroes like Sigmar Heldenhammer are copied by hand in the
scriptoriums of Sigmar and Ulric, and given or sold to the faithful.
Of these tomes, the Deus Sigmar is the most common and well
known, but other texts such as the Scriptures of Sigmar are also sold
to those who follow the faith. A holy man can recite his prayers from
such a book, strengthening his faith and belief.
[Warrior-Priests & Sisters of Sigmar Only]
A Warrior Priest or Sister of Sigmar with a holy tome can
add +1 to the score when determining whether he (or she) can
recite a spell successfully or not.
```
##### Liber Bubonicus

```
[Skaven, Clan Pestilens Only]
If a Clan Pestilens warband includes a Pestilens Sorcerer, he
may use the Liber Bubonicus to permanently learn an
additional spell randomly chosen from the Horned Rat spell
list. A Plague Priest may use the Liber Bubonicus to learn the
Horned Rat magic if he has the Magical Aptitude skill: that
means he would gain the special rule "Spellcaster: is a
spellcaster and may cast spells from the Horned Rat spell
list." and permanently learn a randomly chosen spell from the
Horned Rat spell list. The Liber Bubonicus may be used a
single time, and a warband cannot have and use more than
```
Assembled By Paul H Page 41 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


one Liber Bubonicus in a given campaign (Clan Pestilens
members use this item instead of the Tome of Magic).

##### Liturgicus Infecticus

```
[Skaven, Pestilens Only]
A Clan Pestilens member, usually a Plague Monk, may carry
with him a scroll with the holy Liturgicus Infecticus inscribed
on it. This is the Clan Pestilens chant in favour of diseases
and contagion. At the beginning of a turn, or just before
taking a Route Test, the warband may chant the Liturgicus
Infecticus, and benefit of a +1 Leadership bonus until the end
of the turn. (Clan Pestilens members use this item instead of
the War horn).
```
##### Magic Gugginz

```
[Greenskins Only]
These are odds and ends carried around by the Shaman to
focus his powers. Most are bat feet, lizard lips, and the like,
but still seem to provide benefits to their owner. The Shaman
may re-roll a failed magic test on a D6 roll of 4+.
● Rare: Greenskins may consider Magic Gugginz as a Rare
9.
```
##### Mordheim Map

```
Some survivors of the cataclysm still remain in the many settlements
around Mordheim, and make a living by preparing maps of the city
from memory. Many of these maps are faked, and even real ones are
often crude and inaccurate.
A map can help a warband find their way through the
confusing maze of streets and into areas with rich buildings
to loot. When you buy a map, roll a D6:
1 Fake: The map is a fake, and is completely worthless.
It leads you on a fool’s errand. Your opponent may
automatically choose the next scenario you play.
2-3 Vague: Though crude, the map is generally accurate
(well... parts of it are... perhaps!). You may re-roll
any one dice during the next exploration phase if you
wish but you must accept the result of the second roll
4 Catacomb Map: The map shows a way through the
catacombs into the city. You may automatically
choose the scenario next time you fight a battle.
5 Accurate: The map is recently made and very
detailed. You may re-roll up to three dice during the
next exploration phase if you wish. You must accept
the result of the second roll.
6 Master Map: This is one of the twelve master maps
of Mordheim made for Count von Steinhardt of
Ostermark. From now on you may always re-roll one
dice when rolling on the Exploration chart as long as
the Hero who possesses this map was not taken out of
action in the battle.

##### Scroll of the Rat Familiar

[Skaven Only]
The Scroll of the Rat Familiar has a spell inscribed on it,
usable by a Pestilens Sorcerer as many times as he wants. If
the warband includes at least a Giant Rat, the spell may be
cast on it before the combat begins, transforming it in a Rat
Familiar. If his Rat Familiar is within 6'', the sorcerer may
reroll once in a game the dice to overcome the difficulty of a
spell. A sorcerer may only have one Rat Familiar at any one
time, it is a henchman and it counts normally toward the
maximum number of models permitted to the warband. If the
sorcerer dies, his Rat Familiar turns back to Giant Rat form.

```
(Clan Pestilens members use this item instead of the normal
Familiar).
```
##### Tome of Magic

```
[Not available to Witch Hunters or Sisters of Sigmar]
Sometimes books of forbidden lore are offered for sale in the
markets and dark alleys of the settlements around Mordheim.
If a warband includes a wizard, he will gain an extra spell
from the tome, permanently. He may randomly generate this
new spell from his own list or the Lesser Magic list. See the
Magic section for details. The benefits from each Tome of
Magic apply to only one model.
```

#### Musical Instruments

A musician must have an instrument to play so he can sing songs, tell tales and make hideous noises.

##### Drum

[Musician only]
These are barrels with a tanned hide stretched over them to make
the sound.
The mallet may be used as a club and the drum as a shield.

##### Flute

[Musician only]
These are made of wood or bone.
They add +1 to your leadership roll.

##### Horn

[Musician only]
These are brass or silver horns that can make a lot of noise when
used.
They increase the range of Cacophony by 6 inches.

##### Lyre

[Musician only]
These are made of wood with strings strung to play tunes.
When using this with the minstrel skill it adds 1d6 to the gold
earned.

##### War Horn

```
The blaring sound of a war horn can be enough to stir the
hearts of any warband which it is attempting to bolster. It
grants men courage and gives them the will to fight on
defiantly. A war horn may be sounded once per battle at the
beginning of any of the player's turn. It allows the warband to
increase its Leadership by +1. The effect will last until the
start of the next turn. The war horn can be used just before a
warband is about to take a Rout test.
```
##### War Horn of Nagarythe

```
[Shadow Warriors Only]
Similar to the Standard of Nagarythe, units of Shadow
Warriors sent into Mordheim often bring with them a war
horn to rally around. The rules for the War Horn of
Nagarythe are the same as for a normal War Horn.
```
#### Explosives

##### Fire Bomb

Designed by the dwarf engineers of the Worlds Edge
Mountains, fire bombs are a rare and deadly weapon. A small
batch of gunpowder is sealed within an iron casting with a
short fuse fed into it. When lit, the thrower has only seconds
before the gunpowder ignites and explodes. This can often
prove to be dangerous, as if the fire bomb is fused incorrectly
it could be the thrower who finds himself amidst the
explosion... The fire bomb may be thrown in the Shooting
phase in the same way as blessed water (p53 Mordheim
rulebook). If the bomb lands on target, the warrior hit takes
D3 Strength 4 hits with no saves for armour and all warriors,
friend or foe, within 1” of him take 1 Strength 3 hit with
saves as normal. If the throwing warrior rolls 1 when rolling
to hit, the bomb misfires and explodes just as if the throwing
warrior had been hit by his own fire bomb.

##### Flash Powder

An ancient Dwarf creation, flash powder is used in mines to
illuminate darkened fissures in the search for gold and other
precious minerals. In Mordheim, small bags of this substance
can be used to blind enemies, throwing them into disarray as
you launch your attack. Flash Powder can be thrown as and
enemy charges the wielder (as an interrupt). The charger
must take and immediate Initiative test in order to cover their
eyes. If he fails, he is temporarily blinded and it counts as a
failed charge. There is only enough flash powder for one use
during the battle.

##### Smoke Bombs

```
When thrown these bags of powder explode with a small bang and
release a cloud of smoke that obscures vision and confuses anyone
caught within the explosion.
When a smoke bomb goes off it makes a column of smoke 2"
wide that blocks line of sight for one turn. Any model caught
in the smoke should make an Initiative test so you see if he
can move to the right direction. Otherwise use a scatter dice
(or similar) to see where he moves to. At the end of each turn
roll a D6.
Dissipation chart
D6 Result
1 The smoke hasn't changed. Leave it in place at the
same size.
2 - 5 It shrinks half it size (when it get less than a haft
inch the smoke dissipate).
6 the wind catches it and blows it away
Inside: If the smoke bomb goes off indoors (or in dwarven
tunnels, Khemri tombs, etc) there wouldn't really be much
breeze to blow it away and you would have to wait for it to
dissipate so subtract one from all rolls on the dissipation
chart.

#### Other Items

##### Caltrops

Original used on the battlefield to impede cavalry charges, a caltrop
is a small spiked iron ball. In the City of the Damned, a pouch of
these small items can be enough to deter any attacker who risks
serious injury should they try to charge over them.
There are enough caltrops to last for one use only. They may
be used when an opponent decides to charge. The defender
simply throws the caltrops into the path of his attacker and
they reduce his charge range by D6 inches. If this means that
the attacker cannot reach his target then it is a failed charge.

##### Lantern

A model that is in possession of a lantern may add +4" to the
distance from which he is able to spot hidden enemies.

##### Lock Picks

A standard piece of kit for less scrupulous characters. A set
of lock picks may be used by those who rely more on skill-at-
arms and speed of thought than brute strength to open doors
that others have secured. A model equipped with a set of lock
picks may make his test to open doors on his Initiative rather
than his Strength characteristic if he wishes. This is done at
the end of his Movement phase as if the model were ripping
the door off its hinges, though he uses his Initiative rather
than Strength, there is no -1 modifier, and there is no chance
that the door is too damaged to be locked again later.

##### Net

Steel nets, such as those used by Pit Fighters, can be used in
battles. Once per game, the net may be thrown in the shooting
phase instead of the model shooting a missile weapon. Treat
the net as a missile weapon in all respects with a range of 8".
Use the model’s BS to determine whether the net hits or not –
there are no movement or range penalties. If it hits, the target
must immediately roll a D6. If the result is equal to, or lower
than his Strength, he rips the net apart. If the result is higher,
he may not move, shoot or cast spells in his next turn,
although he is not otherwise affected. In either case the net is
lost.

##### Opulent Coach

```
Truly successful warband leaders are quite willing to waste their
money on extravagant excesses such as rare wines, jewel-encrusted
weapons and armour and Cathayan spices. The height of such
indulgence is an opulent coach, which the warband leader can use
for driving around the settlements surrounding Mordheim. There
are few things that will impress commoners, or incur the wrath and
envy of other, less successful leaders, as much as an opulent coach.
Special Rules
The opulent coach impresses even the most suspicious
merchant and they will flock to offer their most exotic wares
to the obviously rich warband leader. The warband leader
gains +3 to any rolls to locate rare items.
```
##### Rope & Hook

```
A warrior using a rope & hook will find it much easier to move
amongst the ruins of Mordheim.
A warrior equipped with a rope & hook may re-roll failed
Initiative tests when climbing up and down.
```
##### Telescope

```
Common to the great astronomers in the observatories at
Nuln, telescopes are a useful, if highly rare, item to have in
the City of the Damned. The keen view offered by these
instruments makes shooting easier and gives an unparalleled
awareness of a warrior's surroundings. Any Hero using a
telescope may increase the range of any missile weapon he is
using by D6” each turn. Furthermore, he triples the distance
at which he can spot hidden enemies.
```
##### Torch

```
Warriors lacking the funds for a lantern may have to make do
with torches. Torches act exactly as lanterns, adding +4" to
the range the model may spot hidden enemies, but has a few
other special rules as well. A torch will only last one game. A
model armed with a torch counts as causing fear in animals
(Hunting Dogs, all riding steeds, Bears, Wolves, etc), and
may use a torch as a makeshift club. When used in combat, a
torch is treated as a normal club, though with a -1 to hit
modifier. Any models that have a Regeneration special rule
(like Trolls) will not be able to regenerate wounds caused by
a torch during the battle. (Torches may also cause buildings
to catch fire.)

### Magic

There have always been those who have used magic: witches
and wizards, wise women and warlocks. But as all scholars
know, all magic is dangerous, for it originates from Chaos,
the source of corruption and change. Indeed, during these
times, sorcery is illegal and punishable by death.
Wizards have little say in whether the world of magic touches
them or not. They are born with second sight and to them the
world of magical energies and spells is much more real than
the mundane world of normal mortals. With all the
persecution, fear and hatred it is little wonder that wizards
become reclusive and suspicious, and many are downright
insane. Some even turn to the worship of the dark gods, and
others follow the forbidden path of necromancy.
Mordheim has become home to many magic users and they
roam the ruins hiding from Witch Hunters. But there are
other ways of gaining power over and above that of a normal
mortal man. The gods watch over their subjects and a priest
of strong faith can call upon them to assist him in battle. Of
these, the Priests of Sigmar are the most common, for Sigmar
is the patron god of the Empire, and his following is strong
during these times of strife.

#### Allocated spells

Most wizard starts with one randomly determined spell, but
may gain more. Roll a D6 and consult the appropriate chart.
If you get the same spell twice, roll again or lower the spell’s
difficulty by 1.
```
#### Casting spells

```
Spells are cast in the shooting phase, and can be used even if
the caster is in hand-to-hand combat. To use a spell, the
wizard must roll equal to or greater than the spell’s Difficulty
score on 2D6. If he fails, he may not cast a spell that turn. If
the test is passed the spell may be used as described overleaf.
A wizard may cast one spell per turn and may not use missile
weapons if he wants to cast a spell. He can however run!
A wizard may not use magic if he is wearing armour or has a
shield or buckler. The only exception is the Prayers of
Sigmar. Sisters of Sigmar and Warrior-Priests may wear
armour and use their prayers.
```
#### Damage

```
Some spells cause direct damage, and are resolved the same
way as damage from shooting or blows in hand-to-hand
combat. Spells do not cause critical hits. Models always
receive armour saves against wounds caused by spells unless
noted otherwise.
```

#### Spell Lists

##### Prayers of Sigmar

Those with great faith in the gods can call upon their divine power. The priests of Sigmar can pray for many miracles:
healing of wounds, strengthening the resolve of their comrades or the banishment of Daemonic creatures and the Undead.
The Prayers of Sigmar can be used by Witch Hunter Warrior Priests and Sigmarite Matriarchs. A warrior may use the divine
power of Sigmar while wearing armour. Prayers of Sigmar are not regarded as spells, so any special protection against spells
does not affect them.
D6 Result
1 The Hammer of Sigmar Difficulty 7
This weapon of the faithful glows with a golden light, imbued as it is with the righteous power of Sigmar.
The wielder gains +2 Strength in hand-to-hand combat and all hits he inflicts cause double damage (e.g., 2 wounds
instead of 1). The Priest must test each shooting phase he wants to use the Hammer.
2 Hearts of Steel Difficulty 8
As the three words of power are spoken, waves of glory surround the servant of Sigmar. The faithful are heartened by
the warrior god’s presence.
Any allied warriors within 8" of the warrior become immune to Fear and All Alone tests. In addition, the whole
warband gains +1 to any Rout tests they have to make. The effects of this spell last until the caster is knocked down,
stunned or put out of action. If cast again the effects are not cumulative, i.e., the maximum bonus to Rout tests remains
+1.
3 Soulfire Difficulty 9
The wrath of Sigmar comes to earth. Purifying flames surround the Priest and wipe out those who resist the righteous
fury of the God-Emperor!
All enemy models within 4" of the servant of Sigmar suffer a Strength 3 hit. No armour saves are allowed. The servants
of darkness and Chaos are especially susceptible to Sigmar’s holy power.
Undead and Possessed models in range suffer a Strength 5 hit instead.
4 Shield of Faith Difficulty 6
A shield of pure white light appears in front of the Priest. As long as his faith remains strong the shield will protect him.
The Priest is immune to all spells. Roll at the beginning of each turn in the recovery phase. On a roll of 1 or 2 the shield
disappears.
5 Healing Hand Difficulty 5
Laying hands upon a wounded comrade, the servant of Sigmar calls upon his Lord to heal the warrior’s wounds.
Any one model within 2" of the Priest (including himself) may be healed. The warrior is restored to his full quota of
Wounds. In addition, if any friendly models within 2" are stunned or knocked down, they immediately come to their
senses, stand up, and continue fighting as normal.
6 Armour of Righteousness Difficulty 9
Impenetrable armour covers the Priest and the fiery image of a twin-tailed comet burns above his head.
The Priest has an armour save of 2+ which replaces his normal armour save. In addition, he causes fear in his enemies
and is therefore immune to fear himself.
The power of the Armour of Righteousness lasts until the beginning of the Priest’s next Shooting phase.

##### Prayers of Shallaya

D6 Result
1 Regeneration Difficulty Auto
After the game the Priestess may Heal 1 serious Injury of any 1 Hero. Optionally, 1 Hero may reroll a 'Dead' result,
ignoring Robbed, Captured, Horrible Scars, and Sold to the Pits;
2 Heal Difficulty 5
Restores a single unit (including self) to full wounds, Stunned models become knocked down, Knocked Down stand up:
Range: 2".
Note: If the priestess deliberately Heals an opponent, she gains an additional experience point.
3 Mass Heal Difficulty 7
Restores 1 wound to all units within 2" of the priestess including enemies except true Undead and Possessed, whom it
causes a wound to. Stunned models become knocked down, Knocked Down stand up: range: 2" radius
4 Antidote Difficulty 6
Nullifies all effect of any poison or drug on any one model, friendly or enemy: Range: 12"
5 Helping Hands Difficulty 7
Target stunned model instantly recovers their feet and may fight as normal in the ensuing Hand-to-Hand action. Range:
12"
6 Protection of Shayalla Difficulty 8
The target model (may cast on self) gains a 4+ Unmodified save against any attack that causes a wound, in addition to
any other save. The effect persists, but a roll must be made for the affected model during their own recovery phase; on a
1 or a 2 the effect fizzles. Range: 6"

##### Prayers of Taal

Taal is the God of Nature and demands the respect of all those who enter the wild regions of the Empire. He is
portrayed as a tall, broad-shouldered man with long wild hair and a thick beard. He wears a stag skull as a helm and is
clothed in bison and bear skins. He is often called the Lord of Beasts. His followers include rangers, trappers and those
who live in the wilds of the Empire.
Prayers of Taal work like the Prayers of Sigmar although the Taal Priest never wears armour.
D6 Result
1 Stag’s Leap Difficulty 7
Many of Taal’s priests wear a stag skull as a symbol of their devotion and the Forest Lord’s power can be used to
emulate the speed and beauty of this magnificent beast.
The Priest of Taal may immediately move anywhere within 9", including into base-contact with the enemy, in which
case he counts as charging and gains a +1 Strength to his first round of attacks. If he engages a fleeing enemy, in the
close combat phase he will score one automatic hit at +1 Strength and then his opponent will flee again (if he survives).
2 Blessed Ale Difficulty 5
Like his brother Ulric, Taal has a great appetite for the strong ales of the Northern Empire. During the summer equinox
each village in Ostland opens one keg of ale (at least!) in Taal’s honour.
Drinking a flask of Taal-blessed ale (the priest is assumed to carry as many flasks as are needed) may heal any one
model within 2" of the Priest (including himself). The warrior is restored to his full quota of Wounds. In addition, any
living enemy models (not Undead or Possessed) within 2" of the Priest will be lose 1 Attack during the next round of
combat due to the potent fumes of the ale.
3 Bear’s Paw Difficulty 7
Many an armoured knight has been knocked to the ground by the surprising Strength of the followers of Taal. Although
traditionally called ‘Bear’s Paw’ this spell is sometimes referred to as ‘Moose’s Breath’ by those Ostlander’s who have
felt its power.
The Priest invokes the blessing of Taal on himself or a single friendly model within 6". The target receives a bonus of
+2 to his Strength until the Priest’s next turn.
4 Earthshudder Difficulty 9
Taal’s domain includes both the earth and the skies and his power can reach out even into the dark streets of
Mordheim. When his name is invoked three times and the blood of an eagle is poured on the ground, the Lord of the
Wild will cause thunder to rumble and the earth to shake.
The spell is cast on a single building within 4". Any enemy models touching the building will suffer a single S3 hit. In
addition the building will collapse and any models on it will count as having fallen to the ground (for example a model
falling 5" to the tabletop must pass two Initiative tests to avoid taking D3 S5 hits.) Remove the terrain feature from the
board for the rest of the game.
5 Tanglefoot Difficulty 8
It is said that when Taal walked the earth, living things would spring up behind him as he passed. A portion of his
power can be summoned by his followers to help regrow forests and aid in the return of the land to its natural state.
Plants, vines and even small trees burst forth from the earth, hindering all those who attempt to move through them. All
models (friend as well as foe) with the exception of Ostlander Jaeger within 12" of the Priest can only move at 1/2
speed until the next shooting phase.
6 Summon Squirrels Difficulty 7
Taal is the master of all beasts both great and small. Those who anger him may be mauled by a mountain lion or
drowned in a flood caused by an angry beaver.
With this spell the Priest invokes the wrath of the Lord of Beasts, summoning forth dozens upon dozens of enraged
squirrels. The furious rodents assault one enemy within 12" of the Priest, crawling inside the warrior’s clothing and
armour, pelting him with nuts and causing numerous tiny bites and welts. The target suffers 2D6 Strength 1 hits. No
armour saves allowed.

##### Prayers of Ulric

In a similar way to Sigmarite Sisters and Warrior-Priests and their prayers to Sigmar, Wolf Priest call upon their god
for assistance in times of battle. Wolf Priest may use a wolf cloak and still chant these prayers. They are prayers, not
spells, and thus any special protection against spells does not affect them. Wolf Priest use the rules for magic with the
following prayers.
D6 Result
1 Snow Squall Difficulty 6
Ulric extends his protection to the Wolf Priest in the form of a localized snow squall that engulfs the model. All enemy
models in Hand-to-Hand combat with the abbess are at -1 to hit due to the swirling snow and winds. The spell lasts for
the duration of the Hand-to-Hand combat.
2 Hammerschlag Difficulty 10
The Wolf Priest calls down a hammer blow from Ulric on any model within 6". That model suffers a S4 attack from an
enormous ethereal hammer, including the concussion special rule.
3 Bloodlust Difficulty 7
The Wolf Priest is infused with a lust for battle and attacks wildly. All attacks are at S +2, and she scores a critical hit
on a 5-6. The Abbess must test, by rolling the prayer's difficulty or greater on 2d6, each turn to see if the prayer remains
in effect.
4 Wolf's Hunger Difficulty 7
One member of the warband (abbess's choice) is thrown into a Frenzy.
5 Ulric's Howl Difficulty 10
The Wolf Priest’s prayer is answered as an ear-shattering inhuman howl roars from him throat. For the duration of the
battle, all members of the priest's warband are immune to Fear, Terror or All Alone tests as they feel the presence of
their god. Additionally, all Rout tests are at +1.
6 Call of Ulric Difficulty 10
The Wolf Priest lets out a cry of agony as her body re-shapes itself into that of a huge, slavering wolf with the following
profile:
Profile M Ws Bs S T W I A Ld
Wolf Form 6 4 0 4 4 1 5 2 6
During the time that the Wolf Priest is in the form of a wolf, she may do nothing but attack as a wolf, therefore, no
spell-casting or weapons use.
He still hates Sigmar's minions, however. In each shooting phase, the Wolf Priest may choose to make a Ld test (using
the wolf's Ld 6) to regain her human form. If she is still in wolf form at the end of the battle, she gets one last chance to
return to human form. If she does not, then she remains a wolf forever! He is still a Hire Sword, and thus entitled to XP
gains and attribute increases. He may only choose skills from the Speed Table, with the exception of Scale Sheer
Surfaces. The max attributes for a wolf are:
Profile M Ws Bs S T W I A Ld
Wolf Form Max 7 6 0 4 4 3 7 3 7

##### Funerary Rites

By Todd Estabrook (legion@ennui.net)
Priests of Morr use Funerary rites to insure that the dead remain dead, that their body is sanctified and sealed and
their soul departed to pass on to Morr. They are prayers, not spells, and thus any special protection against spells does
not affect them.
Funerary rites work like the Prayers of Sigmar although the Priest of Morr never wears armour.
D6 Result
1 Morr's Protection Difficulty 6
The priest of Morr calls out to his god when confronted by an abomination - and asks that he be shielded from the
corrupted magics of the tainted.
Any Magical attacks (spells) made by a Necromancer or a Magister or Daemons, which would be considered a Direct
Attack on the priest of Morr, will be negated if this rite is successful.
2 Death Holds No Fear Difficulty Auto
Priests of Morr must be steadfast in their resolution and as such must, above all else, have no fear of death.
The priest of Morr is now Fearless for the remainder of the combat.
3 Sanctity of the Fallen Difficulty 7
Those who fall shall be sanctified and their soul freed, in the name of Morr, god of death.
The priest of Morr may attempt to perform the Rite of Sanctity on a model (friend or foe) who has been taken Out of
Action. The priest of Morr must be within 6" of the model in question. If successful, that model may not be raised up by
a Necromancer.
4 Hand of Morr Difficulty 7
By his hand, symbolic of the hand of Morr, the unliving shall become as dust and ashes.
The priest of Morr must be in base-to-base contact with an undead model. Before Hand-to-Hand combat occurs, the
priest of Morr may attempt to use the Hand of Morr rite. If successful, Zombies, Dire Wolves and Vampires
immediately go Out of Action. Furthermore, Ghouls and Possessed will immediately (instead of engaging in Hand-to-
Hand) flee their full Move away from the priest of Morr.
5 Do you know who I am? Difficulty 7
Gaze upon me, abomination, for I am a priest of Morr.
This rite has a range of 6" and must be directed at the closest Undead model first, or if no Undead are within range, at
the next closest human servant of the Undead (Dregs, Ghouls, Necromancers), or finally at any model. If successful,
that model is immediately Stunned. If the model cannot be Stunned, then it is Knocked Down instead.
6 I am death! Difficulty 8
I am a priest of Morr, god of death!
It is a well known fact that the priests of Morr are not martially inclined. Their divine duties involved the dead, not the
taking of life. However, there are times when a priest of Morr will be called to engage in combat and who would be
more feared than a representative of the god of Death? This spell gives the priest of Morr a 6+ armour save and
increases their WS by either +1 or makes it 4, whichever is greater.

##### Prayers of Ranald

D6 Result
1 Thief's speed Difficulty 6
Calling upon Ranald, the priest moves with an almost supernatural speed.
The priest may immediately make a 12" move to anywhere.
2 Fool's Gold Difficulty 9
With a brief mutter, a pile of gold appears on the pavements, luring the unresisting to it.
Nominate a spot within 8" of the caster. All members of the opposing warband that can see it must run towards it,
unless they pass a Ld test. The enemy leader is always immune, as is anyone immune to psychology. This lasts for a
turn
3 Ogre's Head Difficulty 7
The priest's head suddenly takes the form of an ogre.
The priest causes fear for a turn.
4 Sleep Difficulty 10
The priest causes his foes to sleep while he runs away.
All enemy models within 4" have to take a Ld test or they become stunned, even if they have more than one wound.
Helmets won't save them.
5 Luck of Ranald Difficulty 6
Ranald smiles on fools and gamblers and his blessings are upon the priest.
The Priest may reroll any dice-roll in the next turn.
6 Shadows of Ranald Difficulty 6
The priest moves into the shadows, obscuring him from would be chargers.
The priest may not be charged. If in combat, move him 1" apart.

##### Norse Runes

The Norse Shaman starts with two ‘Runes’ from the following chart. These are treated in the same way as Sigmarite Prayers
and can be cast whilst wearing armour. Abilities that give saves against spells, give saves against runes.
D6 Result
1 Howl of the North Difficulty 9
Icy winds sweep before the Shaman knocking missiles from their path.
The Shaman is immune to all missile fire. Roll a dice during the Shaman’s recovery phase. On a roll of 1 or 2 the winds
dissipate.
2 Angvar’s Fury Difficulty 7
The Shaman’s howls rouses the anger of the warriors around him to a fever pitch.
All warriors within 8" of the Shaman gain a +1 to hit in hand-to-hand combat against the opposing warband. The spell
lasts till the start of the Norse players next turn.
3 Elvek’s Cold Spear Difficulty 7
A razor sharp icicle flies at the Shaman’s foe.
The icicle has a range of 18" and causes one S4 hit. It strikes the first model in its path.
Normal armour saves applies.
4 Gift of the Fates Difficulty 7
The Shaman calls on the three Wyrd Sisters of Norse legend for a glimpse of the future.
The Shaman may adjust one die roll by +/-1 between a successful casting of this rune & his next recovery phase. A to

##### Shadow Warrior Magic

Shadow Weavers use a strange blend of magic that differs in many ways to the traditional High Magic of their cousins
of the Tower of Hoeth.
Author’s note: Several of the following spells mention that the target must be within a certain distance of ‘a wall’. This is not
literally restricted to walls, but may include any piece of terrain that could be expected to cast a man-sized shadow.

D6 Result
1 Pool of Shadow Difficulty 7
The area immediately surrounding the mage is suddenly filled with twisting shadows that make it nearly impossible to
see anything inside.
This spell allows the mage and all within 6" to Hide, exactly as if there were a wall or other obstruction between them
and their enemies. They may Hide even after marching. This Hiding is disrupted if any enemy enters the area of affect.
In addition, all affected count as being in cover against enemy shooting. This spell lasts until the start of the Shadow
Weaver’s next turn.
2 The Living Shadows Difficulty 7
Shadows around the target suddenly writhe as if alive and move to strike the victim.
The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell at any enemy model within 12" of him and within 2" of a wall. The target
suffers a single Strength 4 hit with no armour saves.
3 Wings of Night Difficulty 6
Wings of darkness unfurl from the Shadow Weaver’s back and engulf him. He disappears, only to reappear in nearby
shadow.
This spell may only be cast if the Shadow Weaver is within 2" of a wall. He is instantly moved up to 12" to a place that
is also within 2" of a wall. If moved into contact with an enemy model, the Shadow Weaver counts as charging in the
first round.
4 Cloak of Darkness Difficulty 7
The Shadow Weaver appears to be swallowed by shadows that even the sharpest senses cannot pierce.
The Shadow Weaver is effectively concealed from enemy sight. As long as he does not attack (cast spells, shoot, or
engage in close combat) any enemy models, he may not be attacked. He may intercept as normal if the player
controlling him wishes, but he does not have to do so (and if he does not, enemy warriors may charge past him of
course). The spell lasts until the Shadow Weaver attacks an enemy model. Note that a model engaged in close combat
with an enemy warrior may never choose to not attack.
5 Shadowbind Difficulty 9
Tendrils of darkness rise from the shadows to engulf an enemy warrior, rendering him helpless to the whims of the
Shadow Weaver.
The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell at any enemy model within 24" of him and 2" of a wall. The target may not
move unless it first passes a Strength test on 2D6 at the start of his turn (before the Recovery Phase). This spell lasts
until the Shadow Weaver suffers a Wound or attempts to cast another spell. If attacked while affected by this spell, treat
the target exactly as if he were Stunned.
6 Shield of Shadow Difficulty 7
Shadows congeal and become a solid barrier in front of the Shadow Weaver or one of his comrades, protecting the
target from enemy attacks.
The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell on himself or a member of his warband within 12". The target receives an
armour save of 5+ that is not modified by the attacker’s Strength. The spell lasts until the start of the Shadow Weaver’s
next turn.

##### Fey Magic

Wood elf magic draws upon the raw forces of nature granting the mage the ability to wield some of its primordial power.

- Tree Singing Difficulty 5
The Spellsinger encourages the spirits of the woods to make the forest shift and begin moving.
This spell can be cast on any woodland, tree, shrub, etc within 24" of the caster, provided there are no enemy models
    within. The spell makes the chosen woodland move 2D3" in a direction nominated by the caster before rolling. Any
    friendly model within the woodland will move with the woodland. The woodland must stop 1" away from any enemy
    models.

3 Hunting Spear Difficulty 9
The wizard hurls a mystical spear at any enemy model within LOS not fighting in Hand to Hand, rolling to hit using his

4 Thorn Call Difficulty 8
Thick Vines sprout out of the ground tearing and ensnaring its victim.
This spell has a range of 12". The spell may be cast on a single enemy model entrapping the victim in constricting
    thorny vines. The target may test to see if he can get free at the start of his next turn by rolling equal or under his
    strength value if he fails he suffers a strength 4 hit as the thorns wound him as he struggles. While trapped by this spell
    a warrior may do nothing at all and may not fight if engaged in hand to hand combat if he is attacked this way then he is
    treated as been "knocked down" and if an enemy can wound him he is taken out of action.
5 Ariel’s Blessing Difficulty 7
Tendrils and Vines burst from the Mages arm binding and embracing a fallen warrior, filling him with life and
    returning him to his feet filled with the power of the forest.
The Mage may put any model who has been taken out of action back on their feet ready for action as if they had never
    been taken out. Note if the mage himself has been taken out of action he may not bring himself back to the battle.
    Friendly models taken out of action are left on the board where they perished and the mage may only bring them back
    to life if he is base to base contact.
6 Eagle’s cry Difficulty 8
The caster utters a melodious cry, which sounds like an great eagle. This inspires the elves so much they gain the
    legendary sight of Thuarindir.
All elves within 6” gain +1 on to hit and +1 on the critical hit table.

##### Spells of the Djed’hi

D6 Result
1 Divination of Shirath Difficulty 6

Mage’s next turn.

3 Statue of Light Difficulty 7
A pillar of light transfixes the Mage as another stabs down from the heavens to pin his target.

4 Fleeting Shadows Difficulty 8
The Mage slips between worlds, shimmering in and out of existence and becoming hard to pinpoint exactly.
The first time the Mage is hit in close combat or shooting, the spell protects him and the hit is ignored. Move the Mage
2" from his current position in a random direction (but not off a cliff, etc). This is where he really was all along. The
spell remains in play until it saves the Mage from a hit, whereupon it is dispelled. It may not be cast again whilst it is in
play.
5 Hunter’s Fury Difficulty 9
The Mage gestures at the target, and glowing arrows shoot from his fingertips to fly at the foe.

not, but ignore movement, range and cover penalties. Each arrow causes one S3 hit.
6 Silent Guardian Difficulty 9
Glowing swords appear by the Mage, leaping to his defence if he is attacked in close combat.
This spell acts as an invisible guardian that will defend the Mage. If the Mage is attacked in close combat then the
guardian will fight first with WS5, S3. The guardian will make 1 attack per turn against each enemy that attacks the
Mage. The guardian will not leave the Mage’s side, and will only fight if the Mage himself is being attacked. The
Guardian cannot be attacked in return and will only be dispelled if the Mage casts another spell or dies.

##### Lesser magic

Those who have not been schooled in the ways of magic can cast only relatively simple spells. Many human wizards,
lacking the tradition of sorcery and the grimoires of Necromancers and Chaos Mages, have to rely on their own natural
aptitude and experimentation.
Lesser Magic (or hedge magic) is used by human warlocks. It may not be as awesome as the mighty spells of Necromancers
and Chaos Mages, but it is still dangerous.
D6 Result
1 Fires of U’Zhul Difficulty 7
The wizard summons a fiery ball of flames and hurls it upon his enemies.
The fireball has a range of 18" and causes one Strength 4 hit. It strikes the first model in its path. Armour saves are
taken as normal (i.e., with -1 modifier).
2 Flight of Zimmeran Difficulty 7
Calling upon the power of the winds of magic, the wizard walks on air.
The wizard may immediately move anywhere within 12", including into base contact with an enemy, in which case he
counts as charging. If he engages a fleeing enemy in the close combat phase he will score 1 automatic hit and then his
opponent will flee again (if he survives).
3 Dread of Aramar Difficulty 7
The wizard places a sense of mind-numbing fear into the minds of his opponents.
A single model within 12" of the wizard must pass a Leadership test or flee 2D6" directly away from him. If he flees, he
must test at the start of each of his own movement phases and will continue to flee until he passes a test. Note that this
spell does not affect Undead or any model immune to fear.
4 Silver Arrows of Arha Difficulty 7
Silvery arrows appear from thin air and circle around the wizard, shooting out to strike his foes.
Unlike other spells, this cannot be cast whilst in hand-to-hand combat. The spell summons D6+2 arrows which the
wizard can use to shoot against one enemy model. The arrows have a range of 24". Use the wizard’s own Ballistic Skill
to determine whether he hits or not, but ignore movement, range and cover penalties. The arrows cause one S3 hit each.
5 Luck of Shemtek Difficulty 6
The wizard summons the fickle power of magic to manipulate chance.
The wizard may re-roll all his failed dice rolls, though the second results stand. The effect lasts until the beginning of
his own next turn.
6 Sword of Rezhebel Difficulty 8
A flaming sword appears in the hand of the wizard, promising red ruin to all who stand in his way.
The sword gives the wizard +1 Attack, +2 Strength and +2 Weapon Skill. Take a Leadership test at the beginning of
each of the wizard’s own turns. If the test fails, the sword disappears.

##### Charms & Hexes

Weapon Skill and will move in a random direction at the start of their turn. The Blindness lasts until the Witch casts
another spell or moves.
4 Age of Stone Difficulty 8
Whispering words of ancient power the Witch causes an enemy to age rapidly before their very eyes, making them weak
and feeble!
One enemy model within 12" of the Witch will be severely debilitated and all of their characteristics are reduced by -1
for the duration of this and their next turn.
5 Warrior's Bane Difficulty 7
Muttering a dark and malicious incantation the Witch causes a warrior's grip to loosen, making it almost impossible for
them to attack.
One enemy model within 18" of the Witch will be unable to use any of their weapons as they perpetually slip from their
grasp. They will be unable to shoot and count as fighting with fists in hand-to-hand combat. The enchantment lasts for
the duration of this and their next turn.

veins.

##### Dark Elf Magic

The Dark Elves are as accomplished practitioners of magic as their arch enemies the High Elves but whereas the High
Elves essentially use magic defensively and for the power of good, the Dark Elves utilise the evil powers of Dark Magic a
very destructive force indeed.
D6 Result
1 Doombolt Difficulty 9
Whispering an ancient incantation the Sorceress conjures a bolt of pure dark energy and unleashes it from her
outstretched hand.
The bolt of doom may be targeted at any enemy model in line of sight. The Doombolt has an 18" range and causes a
Strength 5 hit. If the target model is wounded, then the next closest model within 6" is also hit on a 4+, at -1 Strength
than the previous hit. The bolt will keep leaping until there are no more targets within range or until its Strength drops
to a one. Each model can only be hit by a bolt once per turn. Take armour saves as normal.
2 Word of Pain Difficulty 8
The Sorceress calls the curse of the Witch King down on his enemy reducing their willingness to fight.
The spell may be cast at an enemy model within 12". The victim must re-roll all successful hand to hand or missile
attacks and all to wound rolls. If the victim wishes to charge, he must pass a successful Leadership test first. Lasts until
the beginning of the next Dark Elf turn.
3 Soul Stealer Difficulty 9
At the Sorceress’s touch, the essence of life is drained from her enemy and absorbed into her body giving him renewed
strength and vigour.
Once successfully cast, the Sorceress has to make a to hit roll against a model in base contact. If the attack is successful
and her opponent is struck, he suffers a wound with no armour save possible. The Sorceress feeds on this life-force and
adds one wound to her profile. Note: the Sorceress can never have more then one extra wound from the use of this spell
and the extra wound is lost at the end of the battle.
4 Flamesword Difficulty 8
Summoning Dark Magic the Sorceress engulfs a weapon in twisted black flames.
The Sorceress may choose the hand-to-hand combat weapon of a member of her warband within 6" to be engulfed in

5 Deathspasm Difficulty 10
The Sorceress channels Dark Magic into her enemy, causing him to writhe in excruciating pain.

The Sorceress may immediately move anywhere within 12", and may count as charging. If she engages a fleeing enemy
in the close combat phase she will score 1 automatic hit and then the opponent will flee again.

##### Necromancy

Necromancy is the magic of the dead. It grants Necromancers the power to raise the dead and command spirits, but also to
destroy the vitality of the living.
D6 Result
1 Lifestealer Difficulty 10
The Necromancer sucks out the very essence of life from his victim, stealing its vigour for himself.
You may choose a single model within 6". The target suffers a wound (no save allowed) and the Necromancer gains an
extra wound for the duration of the battle. This may take the Necromancer’s Wounds above his original maximum
value. This spell will not affect the Possessed or any Undead models.
2 Re-Animation Difficulty 5
At the spoken command of the Necromancer, the dead rise to fight again.
One Zombie that went out of action during the last hand-to-hand combat or Shooting phase immediately returns to the

with an enemy model.
3 Death vision Difficulty 6

what happens to the unfortunate warrior.
5 Call of Vanhel Difficulty 6
The Necromancer summons the world of the dead to invigorate his Undead servants.
A single Zombie or Dire Wolf within 6" of the Necromancer may immediately move again up to its maximum
Movement distance (i.e., 9" in the case of Dire Wolves). If this moves them into base contact with an enemy model,
they count as charging.
6 Spell of Awakening Difficulty: Auto
The Necromancer calls the soul of a slain Hero back to his body and enslaves him with corrupt magic.
If an enemy Hero is killed (i.e., your opponent rolls 11-16 on the Serious Injury chart after the battle) then the
Necromancer may raise him to fight as a Zombie in his servitude.
The dead Hero retains his characteristics and all his weapons and armour but may not use any other equipment or skills.
He may no longer run, counts as a Henchman group on his own, and may not gain additional experience. This spell
always succeeds (rules for Henchmen and experience are described later). The new Zombie follows all the normal
Zombie rules (immune to poison, causes fear) except for retaining his profile, weapons and armour.

6 The model gains +1 to all of its characteristics for the duration of the battle.
3 Dark Blood Difficulty 8

### Starting a Warband

Before you begin to play you must recruit a warband to take part in the battle for Mordheim. The warbands are
represented by a whole range of Citadel models available as boxed sets and blister packs. The boxed sets are designed
to form an ideal starting point for your collection and further models can be added as your warband grows and thrives.
In this section of the book we take a detailed look at each of
the warbands and provide the information you need to recruit
a warband of that type.
Use the lists that follow to recruit and equip your warband
(an example warband has been included at the back of the
book.) You have 500 gold crowns to spend. Each model and
their equipment (if you choose to buy any) costs a set amount
of money. As you make your choices, subtract the money you
have “spent” from your total until you have bought all you
can. Any unspent gold crowns are put into the warband’s
treasury and can be used later or hoarded to buy something
more expensive.
To start with you must recruit at least three warriors
including a leader. The weapons, armour and mutations you
choose for your warriors must be represented on the models
themselves. The exceptions are knives and daggers, which
you may assume are tucked in boots or concealed in clothing
if not represented on the model.

#### Skill tables and starting experience

The warband lists also include information about the starting
experience of the warriors and which skills they can choose
as they progress in the game. Some warbands also include
separate skill lists unique to the warband.
The rules about experience and skills will be fully explained
in the Campaign section, so don’t worry about them for now.

#### Heroes and henchmen

For game purposes the warriors in your warband are
classified as Heroes and Henchmen.

#### Heroes

These are exceptional individuals who have the potential to
become legends. Heroes can be armed and equipped
individually and may carry any special equipment they might
pick up during the campaign.

#### Leader

Every warband must have a leader. He represents you, the
player. He makes the decisions and leads your warriors
through the dark streets of Mordheim.

#### Other heroes

Apart from its leader, your warband may include up to five
other Heroes, who form the core of your warband. A warband
may never include more Heroes of any specific type than the
number given in the Warband list. This means that some
warbands can only get the maximum of six Heroes by
gaining experience with their Henchmen (see the Experience
section).

#### Henchmen

Henchmen typically fall into two groups. There are
Henchmen such as the Brethren of the Possessed, Skaven
Verminkin and Mercenary Swordsmen. These Henchmen
gain experience and become better as time goes by. They are
bought in groups of one to five models.

```
The other type of Henchmen are those such as War hounds
and Zombies. These are too dim or too primitive to gain
experience.
Henchmen may never use any special equipment you acquire
during their adventures (unless otherwise noted); only Heroes
may do so. Henchmen can include potentially powerful
warriors, but Heroes always have an edge over them with
their potential to gain extra experience.
All Henchmen belong to a Henchmen group, which usually
consists of between one and five individuals. Henchmen
groups gain experience collectively and gain advances
together.
```
#### Weapons and armour

```
Each warrior you recruit can be armed with up to two close
combat weapons (in addition to his free dagger), up to two
different missile weapons and any armour chosen from the
appropriate list. For these purposes, a brace of pistols counts
as a single missile weapon. Warriors may be restricted in
regard to which types of weapons they can use. The
warband’s equipment lists tell you exactly what equipment is
available. Note that you may buy rare weapons and armour
when starting a warband, as indicated by the list in the
warband’s entry, but after playing the first game the only way
to get further rare weapons and armour is to roll to see if you
can locate them (see the Trading section).
You may buy additional equipment between battles, but your
warriors can only use the weapons and armour listed in their
warband entry. As they accumulate experience and gain
skills, Heroes may learn to use weapons other than those
initially available to them.
Every model in each Henchman group must be armed and
armoured in the same way. This means that if your
Henchman group has four warriors, and you want to buy
them swords, you must buy four swords.
```
#### Warband roster

```
You’ll need a warband roster sheet to record the details of
your warband. Blank roster sheets can be found printed at the
back of this book, one for Heroes and one for Henchman
groups. We suggest that you photocopy or copy as many
sheets as you need, so that you can keep a neat and accurate
record of your warband as it changes from game to game.
When you choose a warband, take a warband roster sheet and
write down the details of each Hero and Henchman group in
the appropriate places. You’ll notice that Heroes and
Henchmen have slightly different spaces provided to reflect
the different ways in which they gain experience and use
weapons, armour and equipment.
It is a good idea to work out the warband on a piece of scrap
paper first, as you will have to juggle the weapons and
fighters to get as close to the maximum permitted value of the
warband as possible. If you have any cash left after choosing
your warband write this down in the space marked as
‘Treasury’. At the end of the book you’ll find an example
warband; you can use this if you want or choose your own –
it’s up to you.
```

The warband roster is a record of your brave group of
warriors and is useful to keep beside you as you play. During
a battle you may wish to make notes on the sheet itself, to
record details such as extra experience, equipment used, etc.
You will need to give your warband a name, and also name
all your Heroes and each Henchman group. It’s up to you to
invent suitable names, though you’ll find plenty of
inspiration throughout this book.

#### Calculate the warband rating

```
Each warband has a warband rating – the higher the rating,
the better the warband. The warband rating is simply the
number of warriors multiplied by 5, plus their accumulated
experience.
Large creatures such as Rat Ogres are worth 20 points plus
the number of Experience points they have accumulated.
```
#### Ready for battle

```
The warband is now ready to start its fighting career!

### Warbands

#### Mercenaries

This is a time of unremitting war, civil strife, violence and
famine. A time of orphan children and wanton slaughter. For
warriors these are good times! Since the discovery of
wyrdstone Mordheim has become a magnet for fighting men
from all over the Empire. Nobles, merchants, and the Temple
of Sigmar itself offer rich rewards for shards of the
mysterious stone. Foremost amongst the patrons of
mercenary warriors are the three most powerful contenders
for the Emperor’s throne: the Grand Prince of Reikland, the
Count of Middenheim, and Lady Magritta of Marienburg –
favourite of the merchant guilds.
As a mercenary warband you must decide which of the three
contenders for Sigmar’s throne you are fighting for.
Warbands from different places will vary in many respects,
offering different benefits as well as having a unique
appearance and character.

##### Reikland

Reikland lies at the heart of the Empire and its greatest city is
Altdorf, home of the Grand Theogonist and seat of the
Temple of Sigmar. Reiklanders are devout followers of
Sigmar, the founder, first Emperor, and patron god of the
Empire. The Grand Prince of Reikland (as Siegfried, the ruler
of Reikland, styles himself) is supported in his claim to the
throne by the Grand Theogonist and opposed most strongly
by the Count of Middenheim and the Priests of Ulric.
Throughout the Empire Reiklanders are commonly supposed
to embody the discipline and loyalty of the professional
warrior. Brave and well-versed in the arts of war, Reiklanders
disdain fashionable clothing in favour of well-made and
practical wargear. In battle they often wear coloured ribbons
as marks of identification or authority. They are justly proud
of their dynamic and ambitious Grand Prince and
contemptuous of other claimants to the throne, especially the
Count of Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, whom they
sneeringly call the ‘lap-dog of Ulric’.
Special rules
Reikland Mercenaries are accustomed to the demands of
military discipline and have a strongly developed loyalty
between officers and men. To represent this, fighters may use
their Captain’s Leadership if within 12" rather than the usual
6".
A strong tradition of martial training is also responsible for
the high standards of archery amongst the people of
Reikland. All Marksmen therefore add +1 to their Ballistic
Skill, whether they are recruited when the Warband is first
formed or added later.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.

##### Middenheim

Middenheim stands on a mountain pinnacle surrounded by
dark forest in the centre of Middenland, and is also known as
the City of the White Wolf after Ulric, the old god of wolves
and winter. The Priesthood of Ulric is still strong in
Middenheim where Ulric is venerated as the patron of the
city. The tradition of rivalry between Middenheim and

```
Reikland goes back hundreds of years, and the Count of
Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, is one of the chief
contenders for the Emperor’s throne. As a result there has
always been a great deal of friction between Middenheimers
and the Temple of Sigmar.
Middenheimers are typically large, strongly built men with a
well deserved reputation for ferocity. Many wear wolf pelts
which custom decrees to be the mark of those who have slain
a wolf with their own hands. These grim warriors are
famously contemptuous of danger. They frequently go into
battle bare-headed, scoffing at those who choose, for reasons
of good sense, to wear helmets. As Middenheimers favour
long hair and beards their lack of headgear makes them look
especially fierce when they charge upon their enemies
howling their brutal battle-cries.
Special rules
The men of Middenheim are famous for their physical
prowess. To represent their advantage in size and bulk, the
Champions and Captains of a Middenheim warband start
with Strength 4 instead of Strength 3.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.
```
##### Marienburg

```
Marienburg is the largest and most prosperous trading city in
the Old World. Many call it the City of Gold which alone
conveys a good idea of the wealth of this sprawling
cosmopolitan city. Nowhere else can be found the vast array
of shops selling goods from as far away as the Elven
kingdoms of Ulthuan in the west and distant Cathay in the
east. The city’s craftsmen represent every skill known to
man, and a few others beside, so that it is said in Marienburg
there is no activity that cannot be quickly turned to profit.
Many mercantile guilds have their headquarters in
Marienburg, most important of all the secretive High Order
of Honourable Freetraders which represents the elite amongst
mercantile society. This large, rich, and ambitious body of
men feel themselves shackled by the old order and are eager
to seize power for themselves. Their champion for the
Emperor’s throne is the Lady Magritta. Thanks to the unseen
influence of Freetraders throughout the Empire all the minor
Electors were persuaded to support the Lady Magritta’s
claim. It was only the Grand Theogonist’s refusal to crown
her that denied Marienburg the throne driving a wedge
between the City of Gold and the Temple of Sigmar.
Warbands sent to Mordheim are sumptuously dressed and
armed. Though Marienburgers are often ridiculed as foppish
and effete, their skill at arms and complete ruthlessness has
earned them grudging respect. Their chief skills lie in
duelling and in the use of poisons and other clandestine
fighting methods. Richer individuals dress flamboyantly and
wear jewellery. However, the bulk of most warbands are
recruited from the dockland thugs, ships’ crews, and
stevedores who favour a simpler appearance: leather coats,
bandanas and short swords that are easy to conceal.
Special rules
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 72 Assembled by Paul H


As natural traders with contacts in the merchant guilds
Marienburg warbands receive a +1 bonus when attempting to
find rare items (see the Trading section for rules).
To reflect their enormous wealth Marienburgers start off with
an extra 100 gold crowns (600 in total) when fighting in a
campaign. In a one-off game they are permitted an extra 20%
gold crowns when recruiting a warband. For example, in a
1,000 gold crown game a Marienburger warband will have
1,200gc.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the

#### Averlander

Averland lies in the south of the Empire, between the rivers
Aver and Upper Reik and borders upon the Black Mountains
and the huge range that is the Worlds Edge Mountains. It’s a
prosperous province, though it’s neither one of the largest or
most influential in the Empire. The Black Mountains and the
World Edge Mountains harbour plenty of mines, many are in
Dwarf possession. The metal ore is sold at a good profit in
Averheim, the provincial capital, to merchants from Nuln,
who transport it on barges down the river Aver. The
mountains contain several ancient Dwarf strongholds but
Night Goblins or Skaven has overrun several of them, while
others have been lost in violent volcanic eruptions.
The Black Fire Pass guards an important trade route between
the Borderlands and the Empire; it divides the World Edge
Mountains from the Black Mountains. The route is an old
Dwarf road and extends past Averheim and further north into
the Empire. Goods from the Black Fire pass are usually
shipped along the Aver River to Nuln. The pass is the only
place to cross the mountains, as the mountainsides are
extremely steep and almost impossible to pass. Not to
mention that the weather is notoriously unpredictable and few
dare risk being caught in a snow blizzard or avalanche. As if
things weren’t bad enough the mountains are home to fierce
tribes of Night Goblins, Trolls, Skaven and legendary
monsters. Some daring adventurers have made a living off
stealing eggs from the tallest peaks and selling them to the
Imperial Zoo. These beasts will be brought up to become
mounts for famous generals.
Averland is a rich province and as a result exorbitant sums of
money are spent on the uniforms of the state soldiers.
Seasoned veterans prefer flamboyant uniforms to make them
stand out compared to the peasant, but also to reflect their
seniority. This tradition has seeped down through the ranks to
a point where even the militia and mercenary bands strive to
have as flamboyant clothing as they can afford. The
Averlander army is said to employ enough tailors to supply a
small city! Outsiders joke that the Averlanders are such great
archers because they do not want to get up close and personal
as they risk tearing or bloodying their clothes. Such remarks
are hushed down in the presence of a veteran of the Black
Fire Pass though, or else the jester will soon find himself in
the gutter with a few missing teeth. The practice of wearing
outrageous clothing has certainly appealed to the diminutive
race of Halflings and tailors are constantly being asked to
shorten sleeves and add a little extra width to the waist. Many

```
Young recruits are disheartened to learn that they are
disallowed from wearing the stunning uniform until they
have served at least a year in the army. These ‘Youngbloods’
are by no means regarded as professional soldiers yet and
have to make do with more simple clothing.
The Bergjaeger are a special detachment of the Black Fire
Pass guard that is made up of trappers and rangers from the
surrounding mountains. They are experts at moving silently
through rocky terrain and are often used as scouts. The
background of a ranger is as varied as there are rangers, and
most of them have a story to tell. Some were gamekeepers
who have lost their job or found it too uninspiring.
Somewhere poachers press-ganged into the army to avoid
serving prison time. Some might have been rustlers who
decided to flee to the militia when the angry farmers came
too close to catching him. Whatever their background they
are expert marksmen and well suited to a life in the bleak
mountain wilderness.

##### Heroes

1 Captain
60 gold crowns to hire
The Captain of a mercenary warband is typically a middle-aged
veteran soldier of the Imperial army, most likely he was a sergeant
or other petty officer. The survival of a mercenary warband relies
more on the wit and experience of its captain, than on how good a
fighter he is. It’s all too common that an inexperienced captain will
lead his men into an ambush, or lead them on a long journey with
no food or supplies. Being a successful captain means that your men
will follow you to hell and back, and plenty of gold crowns and
feasting. A captain that fails in his duty to keep his men alive and
well fed will at best find himself deserted and worst end up with a
knife in his back.

Some captains are merchants or nobles that are looking for a

The Bergjaeger are trappers and rangers from the mountains that
surround the Black Fire pass. They are experts at moving silently
through terrain and are used as scouts. In addition they make good

Bergjaeger are not professional soldiers and rely more on stealth

these skills can be put to great use in the ruins of Mordheim.
A Bergjaeger may set a trap if he spends a turn doing nothing
else (he may not set traps if he’s just recovered from being
Knocked Down). Place a marker in base contact with the
Bergjaeger. When a model, friend or foe, moves within 2" of
the marker he risks setting off the trap – roll a D6. On a score
of 3+ he has triggered the trap and suffers a S4 hit (note that
the Bergjaeger won’t trigger his own traps). If the trap did not
wound the model or it didn’t trigger, the ‘victim’ may finish
his move otherwise he is placed knocked Down or Stunned
2" from the marker. Regardless whether the trap was
triggered or not, the marker is removed.

(Brought in groups of 1-5)
Mountainguard
30 gold crowns to hire
The Mountainguard is the famous garrison of the Black Fire Pass
that has repelled countless greenskin invasion attempts. Their
traditional uniform is yellow and black and it’s a merit in the
Averland army to have served a few years at the mountain-pass. The
Mountain guard train both with the traditional Imperial weapons,
the halberd and the sword, and with the crossbow and bow.
Veterans are often employed by mercenary warbands who know that
their presence will certainly boost their chances in the battles to
come. Some of these veterans advance to become sergeants or even
captains themselves. There are a few warbands that consists solely
of Mountainguard veterans, often from the same regiment or the
survivors of a great battle.

Marksmen

Being a Marksmen is not as simple as picking up a bow and try to

chosen weapon, Imperial enlisters often visit archery competitions
to try and enlist a couple of expert archers. Some Marksmen are
trained with black powder weapons instead of the traditional bow or
crossbow. Marksmen often own their own weapons, as the cost of a
handgun is as high as hiring the Marksman himself! Thus the
Marksmen are not forced to do as much hard labour as the militia.

#### Ostlander

‘My only crime was to get in a brawl with some pig farmer outside of the Donkey’s Nut Tavern and the next thing I knew a
dozen of his brothers were after my blood.’ Udo Verkonnen, Freesword
The Principality of Ostland is the most sparsely inhabited of
all of the Empire’s Electoral Provinces. Its people have more
ties with the land of Kislev to the north than they do to their
countrymen to the south. This is because the Forest of
Shadows and the Middle Mountains form two natural barriers
between Ostland and the rest of the Empire. Within the Forest
of Shadows are vast amounts of wild game but also darker
creatures such as Chaos Beastmen and Forest Goblins. The
Middle Mountains themselves are the highest point in the
Empire and their peaks are inhabited by a large number of
Ogres.
Ostland’s isolation has greatly shaped its inhabitants and they
are a poor but hardy folk. Each small village lives barely
above subsistence levels and is usually composed of one
large extended family. The men of Ostland are tall and broad-
shouldered while the women tend to either be tall and
whippet thin or short and stout. Married men are usually dirt
farmers who also gather roots, tubers and nuts in the forests,
while unmarried men spend their lives as trappers and
hunters. The worship of Taal, the God of Forests and Beasts,
is very popular in the region although there is some worship
of Taal’s wife Ryha and his brother Ulric in the more
westerly villages.
While not warlike by nature, Ostlanders are never opposed to
a good honest drunken brawl and with their love of dark ales
these sorts of scraps are not uncommon. During the Great
War against Chaos, Ostlanders rallied in great numbers to
wield bow and spear in defence of their Kislevite neighbours.
More than any other part of the Empire, Ostland has tasted
the lash of Chaos and their hatred of the evil ones knows no
bounds.

##### Special Rules

```
Self-Sufficient: The men of Ostland have no desire to give
their hard-earned gold to outsiders. As a result they can never
hire any Mercenaries except for Ogres (who are not an
uncommon sight in Ostland).
Nouveau Riche: Ostlanders are almost universally poor.
Many Ostlanders never see coined money in their entire life
and those that do are often overcome with giddiness at the
mere sight of wealth. As a result, Ostlanders MUST sell all of
their Wyrdstone (unless they have more than 8 pieces in
which case they must only sell 8) after every battle and after
hiring new warriors (which may be done first) at least 50% of
the remaining gold MUST be spent on a single item of gear.
This means that Ostlander Warbands will often be composed
of a dozen men wearing muddy peasant garb with one
member wearing golden-laid heavy armour and another
carrying a double-barrelled hunting rifle from the finest
forges of Hochland.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.
```
##### Choice of Warriors

```
An Ostlander Warband is often made up of an extended
family of Ostlanders. Fathers, uncles, brothers, cousins and
even the occasion tough-as-nails aunt all join together to form
the Warband. The ‘family’ must include a minimum of 3
models and a maximum of 15. You have 500 Gold Crowns
that you can use to recruit your initial warband.
Elder: Each Ostlander Warband must have one Elder, no
more, no less!
Blood-Brothers: Your Warband may include up to 2 Blood-
Brothers.
Priest of Taal: Your Warband may include up to 1 Priest of
Taal.
Kin: You may have any number of Kin.

More than anywhere in the Empire Ogres are most commonplace
within the hilly, pine forested landscape of Ostland. These brutish
creatures are very sought after by the rough mountain men of
Ostland as muscle in the Warband. An Ogre’s strength is near
legendary and their ability to sustain an awful lot of punishment
during a fight make these the perfect shock troops of any Warband.
Of course, an Ogre’s appetite is nearly as well renowned as their
fighting abilities and so they are rather expensive to keep.

buffoons stagger their way through the streets of Mordheim yelling
slurred insults at whomever they meet, committing petty acts of
vandalism and generally making a mess of things. This comic
behaviour is often misconstrued into a false belief that they are
harmless, a belief that many live to regret. Fuelled by vast quantities

#### Nuln Engineers

Based on Imperial Gunnery School of Nuln from the Nemesis Crown and Nuln Engineers By Josh Alexander
The Province of Nuln is renowned throughout the Empire as
a centre of commerce and knowledge, especially in the field
of engineering, the home to the finest handguns and war
machines, save for those constructed by the Dwarves. The
Imperial Gunnery School located there trains apprentices in
the intricacies of weapon design and maintenance, and is
crucial to the dominance of the armies of the Empire. The
relatively new science of black powder technology is
relentlessly researched and tested in Nuln, borrowing theories
from dwarf engineers and developing new ones through sheer
human ingenuity.
Nuln produces the majority of the cannons and other artillery
desired commodity used by the Empire army. In addition,
most of the handguns and pistols are manufactured in the city
as well. Its garrison is therefore unusually well armed, and
most enemies would rather mount an expedition into the
chaos wastes than an assault on Nuln.
Most of the students at the school come from the Imperial nobility,
sons who show talents in mathematics or an interest in things that
go boom, as well as not being immediately in line for succession.
Once they graduate, students are given the choice of staying in the
school for further studies (and eventually becoming a Master
Gunner) or returning home. For some the prospect of yet more
years of studies will send them home where they will go on to fight
as an army’s pistoleers or outriders, the others do attain their
pinnacle and get to watch their former trainees charge across the
battlefield, often to their deaths.
Mordheim presents an irresistible opportunity to the aged
scholars of Nuln, as the mysterious wyrdstone is said to have
many useful properties. The few shards that have found their
way to Nuln have successfully been used in the creation of
more efficient black powder, as well as the basis of a new
alloy for gunmetal and cannonballs. However, the high cost
the shards accrue on the secondary market makes them a rare
and expensive commodity. Rather than entrust their interests
to the mercenary rabble that wander the lands of the Empire,
the Master Engineers of Nuln have sent out several Engineers
to fetch as many shards of wyrdstone as they can carry. In
their eyes, it is cheaper to simply replace a warband
slaughtered in the ruins than to pay the extra amount for the
scant wyrdstone that is available. These engineers gather
together some of their students and a few city guard and
depart, taking pains to bring along plenty of weapons and
ammunition. While less than pleased at their new occupation,
the engineers owe their very livelihood to the Master
Engineers of Nuln, and grudgingly comply with their edicts.
Engineer warbands are unusual, even for the eclectic rabble
that fights in the ruins. While they employ a few soldiers for
their practical knowledge, most of the groups consist of
academic, scholarly individuals. Many of these scientists
have served in the armies of the Empire and have military
training, rusty though it may be. Some leaders underestimate
the danger they present, for what they lack in ferocity and
strength they make up for with sheer firepower. It is usually
easy to determine if a Nuln warband is fighting nearby,
because the gunshots echo through the deserted ruins and can
be heard even from outside the city walls.

##### Special Rules

```
Impeccable Care: Amongst one of the first things that the
students are taught is to take proper care of their equipment
and the right way to perform that maintenance. Once they
have mastered this function, they learn to repair the same
weapons should they become damaged and because of this
they can buy such black powder weapons on the cheap and
quickly return them to good working order. As a result they
can buy these weapons at a fairly reduced price! They can
ALWAYS use the reduced cost for black powder weapons
listed in their starting Equipment List, and they gain an
additional +2 on rare rolls to find any black powder weapons
since people don’t mind selling broken guns!
Properly Used: The students know the proper way to use
their weapons, spending many hours on the school’s shooting
range. This is considered to be a good use of time between
lessons and recommended by all the school’s instructors,
after all if the students constantly blow themselves up with
their weapons, there wouldn’t be many graduates. When
using the optional Misfire rules, if a one is rolled, roll a
second dice. On a 3+ the misfire is ignored (the shot still
misses, but the weapon does NOT explode).
Proud To A Fault!: Anyone studying at the Imperial
Gunnery School is very proud of this fact, as it is a great
honour to be accepted. After they start using black powder
weapons, students recognise the superiority of these weapons
and refuse to bend their knee to the ‘lesser’ ranged weapons.
The members of this warband NEVER use any non-black
powder ranged weapons (this prohibition does NOT apply to
hired swords or dramatis personae, as they are hired help and
have not received proper Nuln training).
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.
```

A Nuln Engineers warband must include a minimum of 3
models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your initial

1 Engineer
65 gold crowns to hire
Engineers oversee the training of apprentices and are always
exacting and precise. They epitomize the technological innovation of
Nuln, and their aim is usually as keen as their intellect. Instead of
dominating their warbands with fear or brute force, Engineers earn
respect through their experience and technical knowledge.

The gunners of Nuln are the most respected in the Old World. They
are in charge of keeping up the mighty Empire war machines such
as the great cannons. They are well educated and extensively
trained, but not yet too battle-hardened, so these excursions give
them field experience, even in the smallest things.

Sons of the Gun
25 gold crowns to hire
Orphans left on the doorsteps of the school, well cared for and
trained to take care of the constructs as apprentices and assistants.
Many go on to form gun crews for the cannons taken into battle and
some even rise as far as commanding such crews. For the most part
they remain a background element to the successful workings of any
cannon or black powder weapon and have become an essential part
of the school. On the excursions, sons of the guns provide a much
needed set of arms to carry provisions and spare powder, as well as
providing much needed additional firepower in a fight.

living protecting the engineers. While not as adept at using firearms
as their allies, they provide much needed support in the close
quarter fighting of Mordheim.

#### Cult of the Possessed

There is never any shortage of men willing to risk their lives
for a chance of real power: men whose ambitions lie beyond
the scope of their birthright, or whose sorcerous skills or
physical deformities place them in constant danger of
persecution. What do such men have to lose if they pledge
their souls to the dark gods of Chaos! In the aftermath of the
destruction of Mordheim all manner of mutants have
appeared whilst many hitherto unblemished folk feel the
stirring of strange powers, the first awakenings of magical
gifts destined to bring them to a fiery death at the hands of
the Witch Hunters.
Now a leader has appeared, a new Dark Emperor, who claims
lordship of the City of the Damned. He is called the
Shadowlord, Master of the Possessed, and followers of the
cults of Chaos gather from all over the Empire to pledge their
souls to him. Though none know whether he is man or
Daemon all proclaim him their saviour and eagerly seek to do
his bidding.
As all students of the dark arts know, it is by the power of
magic that creatures such as Daemons and spirits are able to
stalk the mortal world. The wyrdstone that proliferates in
Mordheim grants unnatural life to many vile things that by all
natural rights should never exist. The Possessed were once
men but by surrendering themselves wholly to the dark gods
they have allowed Daemons to possess their bodies. Their
appearance is horrific – corrupted from within, their flesh is
twisted into a new and monstrous form.
With the power of the Possessed behind them the followers
of the Shadowlord have grown powerful in Mordheim. In the
Massacre of Silver Street the Cult of the Possessed ambushed
and destroyed a large force sent in to hunt them down. Now
the streets of Mordheim belong to the Shadowlord and his
servants. The contaminated air does not affect them at all or,
more likely, it nourishes their inner corruption. Men who
venture into Mordheim alone are hunted down and sacrificed
to the dark gods. All warbands of the Possessed gather
wyrdstone for the Shadowlord who remains hidden in the Pit
where he is said to be guarded by titanic Possessed the size of

```
houses. A few shards of the precious stone are kept by the
warbands and used to create more of the Possessed.
The leaders of cult warbands are called Magisters and each
leads a group of cultists: minions of the dark gods of Chaos.
These are men whose hunger for power knows no bounds,
who willingly give their bodies over to possession. All take
part in the blood sacrifices, dark rituals, and worship of
Daemons – nothing is too base for them! These degenerate
humans are joined by other creatures as vile as they – things
half-man half-beast that call themselves Gors, and which men
refer to as Beastmen.
There are few sights as horrific as a cult warband. Deranged
warriors smeared with blood and dirt wave jagged weapons
and chant blasphemous rites as they throw themselves upon
their foes. Many are hardly recognisable as human, their
bodies are so scarred and disfigured. The stigmata of
mutation is borne by most, but the most unsettling of all are
the Possessed themselves – melded flesh made of men,
beasts, and metal driven by the implacable will of a Daemon.

A Possessed warband must include a minimum of three

The Possessed have committed the greatest of heresies: they have

lives a supernatural thing of evil, a Daemon from the dark reaches
of the Realm of Chaos.
The powerful spirit of a Daemon can meld several creatures
together, be they men or animals, into a multi-faceted horror. These

Their insane strength makes Darksouls dangerous fighters. The
Cultists regard them as holy men, and let them work out their

#### The Carnival of Chaos

No one knows from whence it came, the dreaded Carnival of
Chaos. Some have rumoured that it was once a gypsy caravan
from the east of the Empire, wandering folk that brought their
colourful fare from village to village entertaining the poor
rural folk of the Empire with their lavish shows and stage
plays. If this past is the truth then what it has become in the
present is far more sinister and deadly. Still it wanders the
rural backwaters of the Empire, in a colourful cavalcade of
wagons, its folk dressed in the colourful finery of travelling
players, bringing sonnet and song to excitable villagers and
peasants.
Upon reaching a new settlement, these outlandish showmen
erect their stage and entertain the poor rural folk with songs
and plays of the dark days of the Empire. Tales such as: ‘The
Emperor’s True Face’, ‘Orfeo and Pustulate’, ‘Papa Noigul’s
Festering Children’ and ‘A Midsummer Nightmare’ wow the
enraptured throng.
Strongmen perform feats of incredible prowess to the
adoration of the crowd, whilst players in garish, grinning
masks juggle balls, knives and flaming brands. As the
crowd’s numbers increase, a fool in bright jester’s garb with
an inflated pig’s bladder on a stick leaps from one enthralled
watcher to the next joking and cackling, poking and
prodding.
It is only when the show reaches its blasphemous climax, as
the sun begins to set, that the truth of the Carnival of Chaos is
revealed in all its putrid, festering glory. For these are no
mere wandering thespians and entertainers. When the players
perform their final act, known as the ‘Dance of Death’, the
enchantments covering their true visages slowly slip away
revealing them to their blissfully ignorant audience for they
are cavorting, cyclopean daemons with rotting flesh hanging
from yellowing bones. What were originally considered
intricately decorated masks and cleverly applied make-up is
soon revealed as the players’ true horribly mutated faces,
covered in pustules and pox-ridden lesions. As the villagers’
expressions turn from those of elation to abject terror at the
sight of these horrific visions the slaughter begins. By now
most of the folk who made up the cheering audience would
have already succumbed to the virulent diseases spread by
these malevolent players. The insidious Carnival Master,
accompanied by his cackling fool, rounds up those
unfortunate women and children that remain alive, taking a
finger from each of his new brides, exclaiming “You’re my
wife now!”. The survivors are then led away to an unknown
fate and the village is left deserted, its inhabitants and
livestock killed by innumerable diseases and plague.
The Carnival of Chaos is the sick joke of the Great Lord of
Decay, the Chaos god known as Nurgle. Thrice cursed
Nurgle is also known as the unspeakable Master of Plague

```
and Pestilence and the players in the Carnival are his corrupt
followers and worshippers. They are those who have sold
their souls for a twisted form of immortality through
embracing death, destruction and decay – learning to love
Nurgle’s many and varied gifts. It is not known how many
Carnivals of Chaos there are or if the handful of reports from
the lips of petrified witnesses all refer to the same warband.
The leader of the Carnival of Chaos is known as the Carnival
Master and is reputed to be a sorcerer of great power,
wielding the unclean magic of his lord to cause suffering and
death through disease and decay. Through dark ritual and
sacrifice, the Carnival Master summons forth the cackling,
decaying Daemons of his patron god to take part in the
twisted masquerade. His mortal followers carefully nurture
their newly acquired diseases, blessings of their gregarious
deity and vie for power and advancement under his watchful
gaze. The most blessed of these twisted, insane creatures are
those known as the Tainted Ones. These are often the right-
hand ‘men’ of the Carnival Master and their bodies are
wracked with a multitude of foul diseases and mutation. The
Carnival of Chaos is justly hunted by the many bands of
zealous Witch Hunters that traverse the lands but always
seems to be just one step ahead of the Sigmarites and
continues to follow its merry path, bringing the blessings of
Nurgle to all.

0-2 Brutes
60 Gold Crowns to hire
These are a very specific type of mutant that have had their
constitution bolstered by the unnatural vitality of the Lord of Decay.
Nurgle’s foul attention has transformed what were once men into
massive, statuesque creatures rippling with diseased muscles and a
supernatural vigour. Brutes are immensely strong individuals and
their part in the masquerade that is the Carnival of Chaos is as
strongmen performing feats of strength to entertain the crowds.
They are nearly always hooded in the nature of executioners for
although their bodies appear outwardly strong and healthy, their
faces are often riddled with disease and are half-decayed. In battle,
they wield huge hammers and flails with reckless abandon, whirling
them around their heads like children’s toys.

0-2 Tainted Ones
25 Gold Crowns to hire (+Cost of Blessings of Nurgle)
The Tainted Ones are those that are most blessed and favoured of
Father Nurgle. They hold a position of great importance within the
hierarchy of the Carnival. They are often heavily robed and
protected by powerful enchantments, for beneath their robes are
unspeakable horrors. The bodies of the Tainted Ones are so
wracked with disease and mutation that it is unsafe for even the
other mortal members of the warband to touch their bare skin.
Ironically, they take the most prestigious role in the Carnival – the
fool. The Tainted Ones leap and prance about the audience, dressed
as jesters, when the Carnival is performing, laughing and joking
with the gathered throng infecting them with their multitude of
horrendous maladies. These twisted creatures are exceptionally
dangerous opponents in combat too, for it is said that they carry the
dreaded and incurable Nurgle’s Rot.

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
0–2 Plague Bearers
50 Gold Crowns to hire
Plague Bearers are daemons of the Chaos god Nurgle, also known
as the Lord of Decay. They can be identified by their cyclopean
faces and horrifically decayed bodies. Their entrails hang from
tattered holes in their grey-green, poxridden flesh and the aura of
death and decay surrounds them. They are sometimes known as the
Tallymen of Plagues or Maggotkin and are highly revered by the
mortal members of the warband. As with all Daemons they can
never be killed or destroyed for good so long as the power of their
god prevails. However, their presence in the mortal world is tenuous
and can only be maintained for long periods by Dark Magic and
sacrifice. In the Carnival, the Plague Bearers revel in their showy
roles as stage actors and players, dressing in filth encrusted but
ostentatious doublet and hose.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

4 4 3 4 4 1 4 2 10
Weapons/Armour: None. Plague Bearers have huge filth
encrusted claws, which they use to tear and slash at their foes.
They therefore neither need nor use weapons and cannot wear
armour.
Special Rules
Cloud of Flies: Plague Bearers are surrounded by a cloud of
flies, which buzz around them and their combat opponent.
They do not affect the Plague Bearer but distract foes by
buzzing into eyes, nostrils and mouths. A Plague Bearer’s
close combat opponent suffers a -1 to hit modifier on all
attacks.

```
Stream of Corruption: Plague Bearers can spew forth a
grotesque stream of maggots, entrails and filth. This is
counted as a shooting attack with a range of 6" and is
resolved at Strength 3 with no saves for armour.
Demonic: Plague Bearers are Daemons of the lord of disease,
Nurgle, and are not made of living flesh but the eternal and
unchanging forces of Chaos. Therefore they never gain
Experience.
Immune to Poison: Plague Bearers are the Daemonic
embodiment of disease and pestilence. They are totally
immune to all poisons and diseases.
Immune to Psychology: Plague Bearers are Daemons and do
not know the concept of fear. They automatically pass any
Leadership-based test they are required to take.
Cause Fear: Plague Bearers are horrifying supernatural
creatures and therefore cause fear.
Daemonic Aura: Due to the magical, intangible nature of
Daemons they have a special Armour save of 5+. This is
modified by the Strength of the attack as normal and is
completely negated by magic weapons and spells. Plague
Bearers’ attacks are considered as magical also.
Daemonic Instability: Plague Bearers are bound to the
world by Dark Sorcery that is highly volatile and unstable. If
taken out of action a Plague Bearer is banished and
effectively destroyed on a D6 roll of 1-3 (do not roll for
injury). In addition, if the warband routs then every Plague
Bearer in the warband must take an immediate Leadership
test. If this test is failed, then the Plague Bearer counts as
destroyed.

Nurglings
15 Gold Crowns to hire
Nurglings are tiny Daemons of Nurgle and are viewed by other
followers of the pus god as akin to his beloved children. They are
like rotten boils with legs and razor sharp teeth, that pick and tear
and infect their foes with filth-encrusted claws. Nurglings are
generally more of a nuisance in a fight than any real threat but in
sufficient numbers can overwhelm even the toughest of warriors.
Nurglings are mischievous little bundles of filth and pus and take
great delight in their part in the Carnival of Chaos, not only as
musicians but also as fools and slapstick comedians. Nurglings
often befriend the children of each village they visit, only revealing
their foul identity to their terrified victims at the final stage of
‘Nurgle’s Great Play’.

opponent suffers a -1 to hit modifier on all attacks.
Swarm: You may summon as many Nurglings as you wish
(i.e.. you may have more than five Nurglings in a Henchman
group).

Nurgle and are not made of living flesh but the eternal and

Brethren
25 Gold Crowns to hire
Brethren are the crazed and devoted followers of Nurgle the Lord of
Decay. They have totally embraced the philosophy of the great Lord
of Decay and the path of damnation is the road that they have
chosen. Most brethren are infected with foul diseases and some have
even started to decay. Their faces are covered in warts and boils
and other lesser gifts of their lord. In the Carnival, the Brethren take
on all of the minor roles: stagehands, puppeteers, etc.

0–1 Plague Cart
120 Gold Crowns to hire
The Plague Cart is the embodiment of Nurgle and the core of the
Carnival of Chaos. Bedecked in the colourful, garish finery of the
coaches of travelling players and thespians, the Cart easily draws
the eyes of the dull and bland peasantry of the villages. However,
the canvas is tattered and rotten, the frame splintered and bent, the
metalwork pitted and rusted and the steeds rotted and dank. Few
mortals have ever seen the interior of one of these most sinister of
vehicles for it is only the Carnival Master and his Daemonic
minions that are permitted entry. It is rumoured that these
ramshackle wagons contain a pentagram daubed with dark runes of
incredible potency that actually creates a portal to the realms of
Chaos and the dwelling place of great Nurgle himself.

Weapons/Armour: None. The Plague Cart’s Guardian does
not use or need weapons but suffers no penalties for fighting
unarmed. Therefore it cannot use weapons and cannot wear
armour.
Special Rules
Plague Cart: The Daemonic nature of the Plague Cart fills
both the Daemons and mortals of the Carnival of Chaos with
vigour. The maximum number of warriors allowed in the
warband is increased by +2.
In addition, the Daemonic Instability of the Daemons within
the warband is slightly offset. Plague Bearers and Nurglings
may re-roll Leadership tests for Instability and may +1 to
their Injury tests if taken out of action.
Guardian: The Guardian comes as part of the Plague Cart. In
fact, more often than not he is physically bonded to the cart in
some twisted nightmare of flesh and wood. He may therefore
never dismount from the cart or leave under any
circumstances. In addition, as he is part of the Cart he cannot
be injured unless the Cart is destroyed in which case so is he.
The Guardian is considered a Daemonic creature and so
never gains any Experience. Attacks from the Guardian cause
Nurgle’s Rot.
The Plague Cart and Guardian are considered Daemonic and
don’t know the concept of fear. The Plague Cart
automatically passes any Leadership-based test it is required
to take.

#### Beastmen Raiders

The Beastmen are brutish, wild and unnatural creatures that
live in the deep forests. Anyone travelling through this
untamed wilderness risks being attacked by these
unpredictable raiders. Many of those who dwell within the
forests around the outskirts of Mordheim claim that these vile
creatures of Chaos outnumber mankind, though such
statements are impossible to prove, for the Beastmen build no
cities and do not create any structured form of society as
such. Order and organisation are alien and hated by them, and
they roam where they will, pillaging and killing for whatever
they have need or want for. They willingly turn on each
other, picking on the weakest amongst them for food and fun.
The Beastmen naturally form into roaming warbands, though
whether they do so consciously or merely instinctively is
unknown. A small warband is able to move swiftly through
the wilderness unnoticed, and can cover hundreds of miles
each season as they travel where they will. They are led by
the strongest and most ferocious of their kind, and if ever one
within the warband senses a weakness in their leader, they
will turn on him in a brutish leadership challenge that can
only result in one of the two being killed and consumed by
the victor. Literally thousands of these small warbands infest
the dark forests of the Old World, preying upon travellers and
farmsteads.
A Beastmen warband attacks without warning, and villagers,
merchants and travellers live in constant fear of ambush from
these forest denizens. They try to prepare themselves for such
an event, and often desperately appeal to the nobles to scour
the forests with their State troops – however, at such a time of
political upheaval, the nobles have far more pressing
concerns than the pleas of low-born villagers. Forced to fend
for themselves, terrified villagers hack down great swathes of
the forest around their settlements, and sometimes hire the
services of mercenaries to protect them, barricading
themselves indoors when they hear rumours of a marauding
band within the area. Nevertheless, purges of the forest are
nearly always hopeless, for the Beastmen warbands generally
move far away from an area they have struck well before
organised retaliation can be mounted.
The more isolated farms and villages are most at risk
from attack, being far from any aid. Frequently, travellers
will discover buildings and farms burnt to the ground, cattle
butchered and lying where they were cut down. Full of
malevolence, Beastmen take particular delight in tearing
down the carefully constructed and ordered structures of men.
They smash down fences and rip buildings down to rubble,
allowing them to be reclaimed by the forests. They
maliciously soil and blight painstakingly planted crops, and
will tear the throats from newborn lambs merely for sport.
Beastmen warbands often form temporary encampments,
from which to raid the surrounding areas. These are crude
things, usually little more than a place to store any plundered
loot and food. They may include roughly staked out pens for
their massive war hounds or for holding captives – both are
taunted and starved for no other reason than it is in the
Beastmens nature to behave so. Typically, a warband will
remain at this encampment until it makes one sizeable raid,
whereupon the Beastman chief will move his camp to another
area. These encampments are often positioned nearby roads

```
and settlements, for such areas are ripe for plunder. The
Beastmen are a constant threat, and even if travellers are
lucky enough not to encounter them, their presence can
always be felt, watching and waiting in the twisted shadows
amongst the dark trees. None can predict their movements,
and many live in constant fear of their attacks.
Beastmen are brutish creatures, the Children of Chaos and
Old Night. They roam the great forests of the Old World, and
are amongst the most bitter enemies of Mankind. The raging
power of Chaos has given them a ferocious vitality which
makes them shrug off ghastly wounds and carry on fighting
regardless of the consequences. Even the Orcs are
comparatively vulnerable to damage compared to the
awesome vitality of the Beastmen.
Beastmen are a crossbreed between men and animals, usually
resulting in the horned head of a goat, though many other
variations are also known to exist. The Beastmen are divided
into to two distinct breeds: Ungors, who are more numerous,
twisted creatures that combine the worst qualities of man and
beast, and Bestigors, a giant breed of Beastmen, a mix
between some powerful animal and man.
The Ungor are smaller Beastmen, who cannot compete with
Bestigors in strength and power. They may have one horn or
many, but these won’t be recognised as those of goat.
Bray Shaman are very special Beastmen and are revered by
all Beastmen, for they are the prophets and servants of Chaos
Powers.
Each warband of Beastmen includes a mix of some Bestigor,
Gor warriors and Ungor who are the mainstay of the tribes.
Seven great Herdstones stand hidden in the forests
surrounding the city of Mordheim. From there the Beastmen
warbands come to raid the city: Warherd of Thulak,
Headtakers of Gorlord Zharak, the Horned Ones of Krazak
Gore, and many others.
The shards of the meteorite are seen as holy objects, which
can be sold to the powerful Beastlords and revered Shamans
in exchange for new weapons and services of warriors.
For the tribes of Beastmen the battles fought in Mordheim are
part of a great religious war, an effort to bring down the
civilisation of man which offends the Chaos gods. After the
taint of Man has been wiped from the face of the earth then
the Beastmen shall inherit.
Appearance: Beastmen Bestigor stand some six-seven feet
tall, and their heavily muscled bodies are covered with fur.
Ungor are lesser Beastmen, no larger than Humans, but their
tough bodies and vicious tempers easily make them a match
to any Human warrior.
Beastmen wear little clothing, but often dress in the fur of
their defeated rivals. They usually carry the skulls of their
vanquished enemies as these are thought to bring good luck.
While most Beastmen have dark brown skin and fur, black-
furred or even albino Beastmen are not unknown.
Beastmen wear heavy armlets and necklaces which serve as
armour as well as decoration.
Apart from the most primitive clubs and wooden shields, the
Beastmen make few weapons. It is not the nature of Chaos to
create, but to destroy.

##### Special Rules

Infighting: Beastmen are constantly sparring with each
other, even in the middle of the battle. If at the start of your
movement phase any Gor or Ungor does not see any enemy,
make a leaderhip test on 3D6 (roll three dices and choose the
two lowest rolls). If the Gor or Ungor fails the test, he moves
full allowed distance directly to the nearest fellow Gor or
Ungor who is not in hand-to-hand combat (if there is any). If
he reaches the member, both may do nothing this turn.
Heroes are unaffected by infighting.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Chaotic

##### Choice of Warriors

A Beastmen warband must include a minimum of three

#### Shadow Warrior Warbands

Nagarythe was once one of the most prosperous and beautiful
of the kingdoms of the High Elven land of Ulthuan. When the
Witch King Malekith and his mother Morathi led the
kingdom of Nagarythe astray into worship of the Chaos
Gods, not all of their people followed. When Malekith led his
people in a rebellion against the rightful Phoenix King, those
who had not been converted to depravity remained loyal to
the throne of Ulthuan and waged a secret war, a war of
shadows, against the Witch King and his armies. When the
Witch King was defeated and forced to flee with his
followers, most of these ‘shadow warriors’ were killed,
drowned by the sea as their land was torn asunder by the
Witch King’s foul magics.
The people of Nagarythe that survived became a nation of
wanderers, moving from place to place and never really
welcomed by other High Elves, for these Shadow Elves as
they became known had gained a reputation for being a fierce
and warlike people, full of cruelty. This reputation, while
probably only partially true, sets the Shadow Elves apart
from other members of their race. This, along with their grim
attitude and generally dark presence, makes other High Elves
feel ill at ease around them. In Ulthuan they are misfits and
outcasts, and many of these proud people seek their fortunes
outside Ulthuan entirely. They truly are a race ‘in the
shadows’ between the cruel darkness of the Dark Elves, and
the beautiful light of the other High Elves.
Some of the Elves of Nagarythe have been driven mad by this
condition, but most have accepted their existence, and are
driven on by a desire for revenge against the arch nemesis the
Witch King and his perverse mother. The Shadow Elves form
themselves into warbands and travel the lands of Ulthuan and
the Known World, sometimes fighting Dark Elves (and other
forces of Chaos) when they find them, and fighting just to
survive the remainder of the time. Some still work in the
service of the Phoenix king, acting as scouts and trackers for
his armies. Sometimes small units of these warriors will be
sent by their king to distant lands on a special mission for
Ulthuan – recovery of ancient artefacts left behind when the
High Elves abandoned the Old World, or sabotage of a
rumoured plot of the Dark Elves. When sent on such a
mission, these bands bring their military trappings with them

- standards and war horns, unit insignia fiercely emblazoned
on their shields – for the Shadow Elves take pride in their
loyalty to the Phoenix King. Other warbands represent small
groups of warriors seeking their fortune... though still loyal to
Ulthuan, they may no longer feel welcome in their island
home, or perhaps they represent a family pursuing a personal
vendetta against a particular Dark Elf leader. Whatever the
case, bands of Shadow Warriors may occasionally be seen
roving the lands of the Old World to exploring the steamy
jungles of Lustria.
Due to their wandering nature, it’s not uncommon to see
Shadow Warriors travelling the lands of the Empire, so they
should fit right in your normal games of Mordheim.
However, the Empire is not the only land these tireless

```
warriors travel to in their quest to rid the world of Dark
Elves. As more settings are introduced for the game, you will
be able to take your Shadow Warriors to other lands, such as
the jungles of Lustria as introduced in Lustria Cities of Gold.
You should not feel constrained to keep the Shadow Warriors
in one city, it is their nature to wander.
```
##### Special Rules

```
Hate Dark Elves: All warriors in a Shadow Warrior
Warband (excluding any Hired Swords) have an unyielding
Hatred for Dark Elves.
Excellent Sight: Elves have eyesight unmatched by mere
humans. All the Elves in a Shadow Warrior Warband can
spot Hidden enemies from twice as far away as other warriors
(i.e. twice their Initiative in inches).
Distaste for Poison: The use of poisons and various drugs is
a Dark Elf specialty. As such, it is frowned upon by Shadow
Warriors, even more so than by other High Elves. Warriors in
a Shadow Warrior Warband may not use poisons of any type.
Unforgiving: In addition to their hatred of their corrupt kin,
the folk of Nagarythe have a long history of struggle against
the forces of Chaos. In multiplayer games, a Shadow Warrior
warband may never forge an alliance with any Warband of a
Chaotic nature (Possessed, Skaven, Beastmen, Dark Elves,
etc.).
Tolerant: Due to their outsider status with their own people,
the Elves of Nagarythe have learned to stifle their distaste for

##### Heroes

1 Shadow Master
70 Gold Crowns to hire
Shadow Master is a very honourable title among the warriors of the
Shadow Elves... it is given to one who has fought in the shadow war
for so long that he rules the darkness that he fights from. Often a
member of the former Nagarythe nobility, the captain of a Shadow
Warrior Warband is known by the honourable title ‘Shadow
Master’. These proud and strong-willed warriors often gather a
small band of their followers and seek a life away from the hesitant
charity and distasteful stares of Ulthuan.

One step down from the title of Shadow Master is Shadow Walker. A
walker in the shadows is considered to have made friends with the
darkness, and while he does not command it, it gives him aid when
asked. Shadow Walkers are seasoned veterans in the war against
the Dark Elves. They are skilled trackers and hunters, and the most
trusted lieutenants of the Warband’s captain, the Shadow Master.

0-1 Shadow Weaver

All High Elves have some aptitude for magic, and those with the

nature of their unending war against the Dark Elves, the mages of
Nagarythe tend to specialise in magics that use shadows to conceal
their presence and confound their enemies. In fact the title Shadow
Weaver comes from the nature of their magic... like a talented
tailor, the Shadow Weaver takes the threads of shadow and fashions
them into shapes and forms of his choosing.

#### Forest-Walker Warbands

Once elves were a common sight in the Old World. After the War of The Beard they decided to leave the Old World and travel
back to Ulthuan but some elves stayed back and settled in the big forests of Bretonnia. Most famous is the wood elf kingdom
of Athel Loren ruled by Orion and Ariel. But the wood elves do not only live in Athel Loren and there are small communities
in most of the large forests of the Empire. On the rare occasions that the Wood Elves willingly enter into discourse with other
races while in search of extremely rare herbs or to check the integrity of magical seals designed to keep intruders from finding
secrets best kept from the prying eyes of the lesser races. But, ever since the appearance event known among men as the
Hammer of Sigmar, (the twin-tailed comet) there have been an increasing number of disturbing rumours that there is a group of
Shadow Dryads in the blasphemous city of Mordheim. Are they the work of Cyanathair, do they belong to the fallen kin of
Coethil or is there a more sinister truth behind these rumours?

##### Forest of Athel Loren

The forest of Athel Loren is typically isolationists, they are
ruled by the demi-gods Orion and Ariel, the King and Queen
of the Woods. Ariel has great sorcerous power and wisdom
beyond mortal ken. With the falling of the comet known
among men as the Hammer of Sigmar, she felt the approach
of a great and evil power; a fallen Chaos lord cast out of the
dark Realms by the other Gods whom it had tried and failed
to destroy. Known to man as Malal, this evil power was now
incarnate on the physical plane and not subject to the
instability that keeps other powers of Chaos somewhat in
check. Ariel saw in her wisdom that the coming of the Lord
of Shadows to the Old World would be a harbinger of dark
times and the beginning of a blight upon the land. It was clear
to her that Malal must be destroyed early or he would grow in
power and spread his poison across the lands. By the time the
Shadowlord turned his eye to Athel Loren he would be too
powerful to stop. Therefore a call went out and the bravest
Wood Elves of the glades of Athel Loren volunteered to
make the dangerous journey across the lands of the men of
the Empire and search out the evil that is Malal and destroy
it.
Special rules
Recruitment: Wood Elves are fewer in number than most of
the other groups staking their claims in Mordheim. To
represent this, it is harder for them to recruit replacements
than other warbands. When a Wood Elven warband wishes to
employ new members, the gold coin cost is paid for all
reinforcements is paid, but the warriors don’t show up
immediately; the new recruits must make the journey from
Athel Loren to Mordheim. Therefore the entire group of
reinforcements will arrive after 1d3 games have passed.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from forest of
Athel Loren receive a bonus of +2 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.

##### Forest of Shadows

```
Before the twin-tailed comet devastated Mordheim the Forest
of Shadows was the home of a magnificent elven settlement
but with the fall of Mordheim horrible beasts and horrors
began to pour out of the city and infiltrate the forest
corrupting the sacred glades. The rumor of the magical
abilities of the Starstone (or wyrdstone as men named it)
spread and the wood elf mages believed that with this power
they could once more restore the balance of the forest and
save the sacred glades that had been corrupted. Thus it was
decided by the elders to send small bands of warriors to
Mordheim to retrieve shards of Starstone.
Special rules
Beast-Hunters: All the Forest-Walker warbands from the
Forest of Shadows Hate Beastmen.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from the Forest of
Shadows receive a bonus of +1 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.
```
##### The Great Forest

```
It is Said that hidden deep inside the Great Forest of the
Empire, high amount the trees you might find the hidden
village of Wood Elves, they have been hiding ever sines the
War of The Beard. It is also said that some are from an
ancient city which was destroyed by the Dwarves. From the
ruins of this city, the now City of Mordheim stands. It is not
known why, but the Wood Elves of the Great Forest are on
the move. Maybe there is an ancient treasure hidden in the
old Elven Ruins or maybe something even Darker hidden
away down there!
Special rules
Waywatchers: Forest-Walker warbands from the Great
Forest may have an addition Waywatcher, but would lose the
Wardancer.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from the Great
Forest receive a bonus of +1 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the

##### Wood Elves Special Rules

Dark Enemies: Forest-Walker warbands may never ally with
Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic warbands (see the ‘Multiplayer
Rules for more details on warband alliances). If ally with any
Dwarven warbands (not Hired swords) then both parties will
count as having distrusted alliance even if both Parties have
the same alliance type.
Excellent Sight: Elves have eyesight unmatched by mere
humans. All the Elves in a Forest-Walker Warband can spot
Hidden enemies from twice as far away as other warriors (i.e.
twice their Initiative in inches).
Forest Folks: The Wood Elves spend their entire lives in the
confines of their forest, to represent this all Wood Elves have
the following:
* Wood Elves gain a +1 to Leadership bonus, while in
woodland terrain. (This bonus will not take the
Leadership characteristic above 10)
* Wood Elves can move through woodland terrain without
penalty
* Wood Elves that deploy behind a tree or shrub (or similar
cover) may declare to be hidden from the start of the
battle.
Tolerant: Due to their outsider status with their own people,
the Wood Elves have learned to stifle their distaste for ‘lesser
races’, and have even been known to work alongside them
from time to time. A Forest-Walker Warband may hire any
Hired Sword that is not of a Chaotic or evil bent (so no
Skaven, Possessed, Beastmen, Dark Elves, Undead, etc.).
They also shun the company of anyone specialising in the use
of poison (so no Assassins) or Black power weapons. Also
Forest-Walker Warband will not hire any Dwarven Hired
Swords.
Wood Elf Archery: When using normal Longbows, an extra
6" range and an additional -1 Armour save. Therefore a
standard Longbow has a 36" range and-1 armour saves vs.
normal armour.
Forest Spirits: The following rules apply to all creatures
with the Forest Spirit special rule:
* All Forest Spirits are Immune to Psychology.
* All Forest Spirits are Immune to Poison.
* All Forest Spirits Cause Fear.
* All Forest Spirits do not gain experience.
* All Forest Spirits treat all stunned as knock down.
* All Forest Spirits have a special save against all attacks,
(3+ for a Great Oak, 4+ for a Tree-kin, & 5+ for Dryads).
* All Forest Spirits are Flammable and will take an addition
S5 hit if they are hit with a flammable weapon.

#### Witch Hunters

The Order of the Templars of Sigmar, universally known as
the Witch Hunters, is an organisation dedicated to the
eradication of heretics, be they warlocks, witches, sorcerers,
fortune-tellers, necromancers, worshippers of the dark gods,
deviants, mutants, blasphemers, sinners, utterers of
profanities, servants of Daemons, or composers of corrupting
music. Indeed, there are few who altogether escape the
suspicions of the Witch Hunters with the possible exception
of other Witch Hunters.
It is wise to remember that the practice of magic in all its
forms is deemed a most heinous crime in the Empire. Death
by fire is the proscribed punishment for this particular heresy.
Many of the Witch Hunters’ victims treacherously avoid their
fate by perishing under torture before making a full
confession. In these troubled times the Witch Hunters are
kept busy as more and more men turn to the dark arts. The
most dangerous of all these heretics are the followers of the
Chaos gods. These depraved individuals practise Daemon
worship and (it is claimed) even offer human sacrifices in the
name of their vile masters. Of all the enemies of Sigmar they
are the most abhorrent!
The destruction of Mordheim has fired the Witch Hunters
with a new and irresistible sense of purpose. In the light of
events the Grand Theogonist has proclaimed Sigmar’s
punishment on the City of the Damned. The Witch Hunters
rejoice that their crusade against widespread corruption has
been vindicated. Now they are ready to complete Sigmar’s
holy purpose by destroying his enemies within the ruins of
the city itself. The Grand Theogonist has commanded the
Witch Hunters to go unto that place and recover the
wyrdstone for Sigmar’s temple. Their crusade also pits them
into the same arena as their old enemies the so-called Sisters
of Sigmar – those loathsome Daemon-worshipping she-
heretics whose very existence is a vile affront to the majesty
of Sigmar.
Witch Hunters are charismatic rabble-rousers who can soon
turn a crowd to their own ends. They are universally dreaded,
for everyone has something or someone to hide, and there are
countless individuals who would willingly and
enthusiastically hunt down and burn their own kin were a

```
Witch Hunter to command them to do so. Bands of Witch
Hunters are often accompanied by zealous citizens,
Flagellants, and even holy Priests of Sigmar as well as the
huge vicious war hounds which the Witch Hunters employ to
track and bring down fugitives.
As men accustomed to fighting Witch Hunters are well-
armed and sturdy individuals. They favour hooded cloaks and
headgear which conceal their appearance from the overly
curious. Some wear chains about their throats to remind them
of fallen comrades and old rivalries and also, so it is said, so
that the iron might serve as protection against witchcraft.
The followers of the Witch Hunters, the rabble that
accompany them to Mordheim, are a far more dire sight
indeed – crazed and self-mutilated men who have lost or
surrendered all their worldly goods and, most likely, their
reason as well.

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Zealots
20 gold crowns to hire
When a man loses his family, home and all he cared for, religion is
often the last refuge left to him. Such men become wandering
pilgrims, bitter and dangerous fanatics who are prepared to avenge
their loss at any cost. These men are called Zealots.
Zealots have forsaken their former lives and exist only to destroy
evil and the minions of Chaos. Whilst they might have been
peasants and craftsmen before, and thus may not be as dangerous in
a fight as seasoned mercenaries, their determination and fanaticism
should not be underestimated. Witch Hunters find ready allies in
their ranks, and many a band of Zealots is led by Witch Hunters.

0-5 Flagellants
40 gold crowns to hire
Flagellants are fanatics and madmen obsessed with the end of the
world. They are often men who have lost their families to war or the
ravages of nature, and have also lost their minds. With insane
persistence, they travel the length and breadth of the Empire,
preaching their view of the end of the world. With their rousing
speeches, Witch Hunters can muster these dangerous lunatics to
fight in the streets of Mordheim, where no sane man dares tread.
Flagellants are extremely dangerous opponents in close combat, for
they have the strength of madmen, and their bodies have become
inured to pain because of self-mutilation.

an Advance roll which would otherwise allow them to do so.
Special Rules
Fanatical: Flagellants are convinced that the end of the
world is nigh, and nothing in this world holds any terror for
them. Flagellants automatically pass all Leadership-based
tests they are required to take. A Flagellant may never
become a warband leader.

#### Sisters of Sigmar

For centuries the nobility of the Empire has sent its wayward
or troublesome daughters to the Holy Convent of the Order of
Merciful Sisters of Sigmar in Mordheim to be initiated into
the only order of priestesses dedicated to the Empire’s patron
god. The Sisters of Sigmar, as they are commonly called,
have traditionally travelled the Empire administering to the
sick and poor, tending to the needs of orphans, curing the
diseased and mending broken bodies. As well as the healing
arts, which they practise with expert knowledge of herb-lore
and prayer, their advice is frequently sought by those about to
make an important decision, for the Sisters of Sigmar are
famed for their ability to predict the fickle course of fate.
Though once much loved by the common people, the Sisters
have seen their popularity wane in recent years. Rabble-
rousing Witch Hunters have denounced them as witches and
heretics, so that even in the countryside they are attacked and
driven away by the very peasants they seek to help. Many of
Sigmar’s priests wish to disband the order altogether,
claiming that women have no right to teach the holy word of
Sigmar. Even the Grand Theogonist, ostensibly the chief
authority over the order, has cooled towards the sisterhood,
denying the throne to Magritta of Marienburg who was
brought up by the Sisters and said to be sympathetic to their
cause. These days the Sisters of Sigmar have retreated to their
convent situated high on the craggy island of Sigmar’s Rock
in the river Stir in Mordheim.
Of all the inhabitants of Mordheim only the Sisters of Sigmar
were prepared for its destruction. Seeress Cassandora foretold
of the disaster and at their nightly vigil the Maidens of
Sigmar heard the voice of Sigmar speaking in their dreaming
minds. Thus they knew that they would be safe in their
fortress high above the city, raised as it is above the polluted
vapours, if only they were prepared to survive the fire of
Sigmar’s Fury.
While the rest of Mordheim fell under a spell of madness the
Sisters of Sigmar offered prayer after prayer, scourging
themselves to drive out all thoughts of sin, fervently
accepting a punishing penitential regime to harden their
minds against the wantonness running rampant outside their
walls. When the blow finally came the Sisters gathered
beneath the great temple dome of their convent which, well

```
built and fortified as it was by the prayers of the Sisters,
protected them from the fire and heat of their master’s ire.
The Sisters believe they have a holy mission, a task that they
have been set by Sigmar himself and to which they must
submit themselves body and soul. Their sacred duty is to
gather up the shards of wyrdstone and hide it deep beneath
Sigmar’s Rock in the vaults of their convent where, shielded
by a great depth of solid granite and guarded by the eternal
prayers of the sisterhood, it will cause no harm to Sigmar’s
people. It is a nigh hopeless task, for there are few Sisters and
countless shards of stone. Worse still, there are many who
want the stone for themselves, to take it from Mordheim and
spread its contagion amongst the cities of the Empire.
The warbands of the sisterhood are led by tough Matriarchs,
each accompanied by a body of warrior sisters. The training
and harsh discipline of the convent includes mastery of
martial as well as ecclesiastic skills, for mastery of the body
is but the first step towards the mastery of the soul. Their
favoured weapon is the warhammer, the instrument of
Sigmar, seen as his holy symbol, alongside the twin-tailed
comet.

#### Bretonnia Crusades

By Sir Tomaso De Merrigan
This is a time when the Empire is being torn apart from
within. A time when there is no Emperor and the lands are
increasingly divided, as individual cities look to their own
lords and mercantile Burgomeisters gain in power through
gold. Where corruption flows like effluent down the River
Reik and conspiracy is rife throughout the land. By contrast,
happy is the land of Bretonnia where chivalry reigns, honour
is upheld and the Lady of the Lake still bestows her favour on
those deemed worthy. To the knights of Bretonnia Mordheim
is a vile place where virtue and order have been discarded.
Where a proud city once stood nightmarish creatures now
wander the streets and mix with men in dens of corruption
and squalor. It is therefore considered extremely virtuous for
a knight to embark on a spiritual quest to Mordheim, seeking
to achieve honour in battle and perhaps earn the favour of the
Lady of the Lake herself. In Mordheim a knight’s courage
and valour will be thoroughly tested, but so much the better,
because with hardship come honour.
A Questing Knight will relinquish his castle and domain to
set out on such a journey. He becomes free from any
obligation to defend a domain and will now seek a road
leading to new adventures. A Questing Knight has put all
worldly ambitions aside and is accorded a rank far greater
then even the most powerful dukes of the land. Such a
gesture is considered particularly noble, and it is not
uncommon for other knights and common folk to flock to the
Questing Knights aid. Knights Errant in particular are eager
for adventure and a chance to win honour by a feat of arms,
so will often join a Questing Knight on his journey. By the
time the Questing Knight leaves the fair lands of Bretonnia
he will have a sizable retinue following him, ready to fight
for the honour of Bretonnia and the Lady of the Lake.
Once on a quest a Knight will be spurred on by dreams and
visions often visited upon him by the Lady of the Lake. This
leads him ever onwards and inspires and encourages him on
his quest. In time he hopes that through his deeds and valour
he will earn the favour of the Lady of the Lake and she will
let him drink from the Grail of Life. This is the final reward
for a knight, and on finding the Grail he will return to
Bretonnia to protect its people. Until that time though, he is
bound to fight the enemies of virtue and order and to endure
incalculable hardships.

##### Special Rules

```
Before heading into battle Bretonnian Knights kneel and pray
to the Lady of the Lake, avowing to fight to the death for
honour and justice. Before playing a game of Mordheim
make a Leadership test against the Leadership characteristic
of the warbands leader. If the test is successful the Lady of
the Lake has bestowed her blessing on the warband. The
blessing takes the form of a powerful curse upon the enemies
of chivalry, and in particular upon those that make use of the
foul and dishonourable weapons of mass destruction. Any
model in the opposing warband who wishes to fire a black
powder weapon must roll a D6 and score 4+ to overcome the
curse, otherwise they may not fire the weapon. The opposing
player must test each time they wish to fire such a weapon.
Models armed with other shooting weapons, such as bows
and crossbows, do not have to test unless they dare raise their
weapons against the gallant Knights of Bretonnia. If any
enemy model wishes to shoot at a Bretonnian Knight
(Questing Knights and Errants only), then they must first roll
a 4+ on a D6 to overcome the curse.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful.

#### Kislevite Warband

The land of Kislev lies to the north and east of the Empire.
The further east one travels the dense forests give way to
open steppes stretching to the foothills of the Worlds Edge
Mountains. The winters of Kislev are harsh and cruelly long
and for months the land is gripped by snow blizzards and ice.
The townships of Kislev are mainly built of timber for stone
is rare and only the most important of the cities have stone
buildings and walls. In the ancient capital city of Kislev the
massive white buildings are topped by vast gilded domes and
decorated with golden statues and gargoyles. It has been said
that Kislev is a poor country filled with rich people. It is
certainly true that the people that live in this beleaguered land
have an outlook on life that strangers often find surprisingly
positive. For Kislev is a country under constant threat of
invasion. Armies of savage Norse often venture into Kislev,
raiding and pillaging, and to make matters worse Kislev lies
right on the border of the Chaos Wastes, so that any Chaos
incursion passes through the land (and its people) first.
To aid them in their struggle against these murderous foes,
the Tzars of Kislev have forged strong ties with the Empire.
This alliance benefits both countries, as the rulers of the
Empire have long understood the benefit of a northern
bulwark against the tides of Chaos. Both countries have a
tradition of sending troops to aid the other in times of need,
and in fact the Gryphon Legion, pride of the Kislevite
nobility, was formed as a symbol of the unity between the
two countries. This knightly order is made up entirely of
Kislevite nobles, but is garrisoned and trained in the Empire.
Despite the constant threat of invading armies, the people of
Kislev sing and dance and play as much as or perhaps more
than the people of any other country in the Old World. Some
say that their relative happiness derives from their love of
strong drink. Whether this is true or not, Kislevites certainly
do enjoy their spirits, and in fact many of their people
attribute almost magical qualities to that most famous of
Kislevite drinks – vodka.
A Kislevite warband represents a group of individuals from
this unique northern realm. Kislevites tend to be quiet in the
face of strangers, but they hold much joy in their hearts. In
fact they are loud and boisterous when amongst their own
people. Kislevites are known to be extremely brave warriors,
and they hold a loathing for Chaos that is much stronger than
most of the peoples of the Old World. While many citizens of

```
the Empire may remain ignorant to the initial signs of a
Chaos cult, Kislevite citizens will immediately seek out any
signs of depravity and cleanse the infected individuals with
sword and flame. Keep these things in mind when you play a
Kislev warband. Most citizens of Kislev have lost homes or
loved ones to the warriors of Chaos, and they realise that
anything less than constant vigilance could lead to their
downfall. They are therefore unrelenting in their resolve
against their ancient enemies. Give the forces of Chaos no
quarter, and expect none in return.
```

```
Ancient Enemies: Kislevite warbands may never ally with

1 Druzhina Captain
80 gold crowns to hire
Druzhina are the minor nobles of Kislev. During times of war these
nobles form their own regiments in a Kislevite army, and they look
most impressive with their ancient armour and weapons, as most of
these prized artefacts are handed down from father to son. Druzhina
are rich enough to afford their own horse and battlegear, and they
must be ready to fight for the Tzar when called upon. In return for
this they are allowed to own land and are given a break on their
annual taxes.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
4 4 4 3 3 1 3 1 8
Weapons/Armour: A Druzhina Captain may be equipped
with weapons and armour chosen from the Kislevite Warrior
equipment list.
Skills: The Druzhina Captain may choose from Combat,
Shooting, Academic, Strength & Speed when he gains a new
skill.
Special Rules
Leader: Any warrior within 6" of the Druzhina Captain may
use his Leadership characteristic when taking any Leadership
tests.

```
Inheritance: When the Kislevite warband is first created, the
Druzhina Captain is allowed to purchase one item from the
Kislevite Warrior equipment list at half the normal cost. This
item represents a treasured family heirloom that has been
passed down through the generations. Losing an ancestral
item is considered very disrespectful and if the item is ever
lost (e.g. from a Robbed result on the Serious Injury chart),
the Captain MUST replace it with a finely-made substitute as
quickly as possible or risk being haunted by the angry spirits
of his ancestors. To replace an ancestral item, the Captain
must purchase the same item of equipment at 150% of its
normal price. This higher cost represents the fine detail and
valuable materials used in the item’s manufacture. Until the
item is replaced, the Captain suffers a -1 penalty to all tests
and rolls to hit.
```
```
0-1 Esaul
35 gold crowns to hire
Esaul is an ancient Cossack term that means ‘Best Warrior’, and
was traditionally given to the most powerful fighter in the tribe. The
word has survived the generations, and today it is an honorary title
given by a chieftain to his personal champion, though it is also used
by Gospodar warriors as a more familiar term for an experienced
veteran. Most Kislevite cities contain at least one grizzled veteran
amongst the ranks of their professional soldiery who has been
affectionately labelled ‘Esaul’ by his men.

0-1 Bear Tamer
35 gold crowns to hire
Since ancient times, bears have featured in Kislevite myths and
legends. Kislevites have a deep respect for these mighty beasts, and
gather to see the trained specimens that accompany travelling
circuses. The powerful men that train these bears are known simply
as Bear Tamers, and the best of them are widely renowned amongst
the people of Kislev. Bears can be trained for martial purposes as
well, and Bear Tamers are often recruited into the armies of Kislev,
where they enjoy a special status among the soldiery.

Special Rules
Bear Handler: A Kislevite Warband that includes a Bear
Tamer is allowed to purchase a Bear as a henchman. This
bear has been trained to follow the Tamer’s commands, and
so will automatically pass its Stupidity tests when within 6"
of the Bear Tamer (even if the Tamer has been Knocked

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Warriors
25 gold crowns to hire
The Gospodar tribe make up the bulk of the people of Kislev, and
they are generally considered the most civilised of the peoples of
this harsh realm. Gospodars are people of large stature with blonde
or red hair. Their women are well known throughout the Old World
for their fair-skinned beauty. Gospodar women have the same rights
as men, and are allowed to rise to positions of power; in fact the
most powerful of the legendary Ice Mages of Kislev are all female!

Weapons/Armour: Warriors may be equipped with weapons
and armour chosen from the Kislevite Warrior equipment list.

Cossacks
30 gold crowns to hire
Cossacks are nomadic tribesmen who live in the far north of Kislev.
They are always the first to encounter any Chaos invaders from the
north, and so have long fostered a bitter enmity with the servants of
Chaos. Cossacks are renowned for their riding skills, and their
favoured weapons are the scimitar (sword) and spear.

members of any warband the players would apply the
Ancient Enemies special rule to).

```
0-3 Streltsi
25 gold crowns to hire
Firearms were first introduced to Kislev by Prince Boydinov of
Erengrad. Though very popular among his people, the prince was
considered quite eccentric (it was he that invented the mad game
called Kislevite Roulette). Despite initial superstition as time past
handguns have been accepted as essential weapons of war. In his
legacy the prince had a large portion of his wealth set aside for the
establishment and upkeep of a regiment of handgunners. The
regiment continues to this day and its members are known as
Streltsi. Soldiers from other cities in Kislev, most notably the
capital, are sent here to train in the use of firearms with the Streltsi.
In addition to their knowledge of handguns Streltsi are also trained
to use a small halberd called the berdiche. In fact the berdiche and
handgun are the most widely recognised symbols of the Streltsi. In
combat Streltsi are able to use their berdiches as rests for their
handguns, increasing their accuracy and making for a deadly
weapon combination.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
4 3 3 3 3 1 3 1 7
Weapons/Armour: Streltsi may be armed with weapons and
armour chosen from the Streltsi equipment list. Note that
Streltsi are the only Kislevite Warriors trained in the use of
handguns.
Special Rules
Gun-Rest: A Streltsi warrior armed with both halberd and
handgun may use the halberd as a gun-rest. The warrior
receives a +1 on his ‘to hit’ roll with the handgun, as long as
he did not move that turn (this applies even if the warrior has
a skill that allows him to move and shoot with his handgun –
he must not move if he is to rest the gun).

0-1 Trained Bear
145 gold crowns to hire
Bear Tamers often bring one of their sacred bears with them when
they prepare to enter battle. These great beasts respect little, and it
takes years for a human to win their trust and obedience. The effort
to train one of these creatures is well worth it however, as one
cannot hope for a more loyal friend or useful ally when things turn
bad.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

6 3 0 5 5 2 2 2 6
Weapons/Armour: None, other than their claws and teeth!
Special Rules
Trained: A bear doesn’t care about the warband’s mission or
enmity for other warbands – it’s just following the orders of
its trainer. Sometimes it gets bored waiting for orders; for this
reason Trained Bears are subject to the rules for Stupidity. If
given ‘special attention’ by its trainer, it will mind a bit
better, so a bear is not required to take these Stupidity tests if
the warband’s Bear Tamer is within 6". In fact this is the only
member of the warband the bear will listen to; a Trained Bear
will never use the warband leader’s Leadership for any tests
it is required to take. It may use the Bear Tamer’s leadership
if within 6" of him however. Note that the warband cannot
control the bear without a Bear Tamer. The Trained Bear may
not be used in any game in which the warband's Bear Tamer
does not take part (and this means that if the warband does

```
not include a Bear Tamer at all, the warband must keep the
bear staked back at camp until they hire a new one!).
Fearsome: A charging bear is a very scary sight indeed! A
Trained Bear causes Fear.
Bear Hug: If the Bear hits the same enemy warrior with both
of his attacks in the same round of combat, the player may
choose to make a single ‘Bear Hug’ attack instead of
resolving the attacks normally. If this option is chosen, each
player must roll a D6 and add his model’s Strength to the
roll. If the Bear’s total is higher or the totals are equal, the
opposing warrior takes a single automatic wound with no
armour save allowed. If the enemy warrior’s total is higher,
the warrior has broken the Bear’s hold and suffers no damage
from the attack.
Fiercely Loyal: Such dedication is built into the relationship
between Bear Tamer and bear that if his trainer is injured, a
bear will often stand over the body to protect it, or even drag
the trainer’s body to safety. As long as his bear is not taken
Out of Action during a game, a Bear Tamer ignores the
following results on the Serious Injury table: ‘Sold to the
Pits’, ‘Robbed’, and ‘Captured’ (and ignore equivalent results
in settings such as Lustria that have their own special Serious
Injury table). If any of these results are rolled for the Bear
Tamer, treat the result as a ‘Full Recovery’ instead.
Animal: Trained Bears are animals and do not gain
experience.

#### Dwarf Treasure Hunters

Dwarfs are a grim and exceptionally proud people. They respect three things above all else: age, wealth and skill. It is no
surprise then that these grim warriors can be found in Mordheim searching for fame and fortune. Mark Havener gives full
rules for including Dwarf warbands in Mordheim.
Occasionally, a Dwarf noble will find himself in desperate
times. His family hold may have been overrun by Goblins or
Skaven, or he may have somehow disgraced himself and
been banished. Other Dwarfs know these warriors as the
Dispossessed. Dwarfs are a proud race and it is against a
Dwarf ’s nature to lose himself in despair. Instead, a noble
who finds himself in such dire straits will gather together a
group of his closest friends and kin and go treasure hunting,
hoping to accumulate a large enough hoard to establish his
own holding. At this time, the largest source of wealth in the
Known World is rumoured to be a city in the Empire. The
city is known as Mordheim...

##### Special Rules

All Dwarfs are subject to the following special rules:
Hard to Kill: Dwarfs are tough, resilient individuals who can
only be taken out of action on a roll of 6 instead of 5-6 when
rolling on the Injury chart. Treat a roll of 1-2 as knocked
down, 3-5 as stunned, and 6 as out of action.
Hard Head: Dwarfs ignore the special rules for maces,
clubs, etc. They are not easy to knock out!
Armour: Dwarfs never suffer movement penalties for
wearing armour.
Hate Orcs and Goblins: All Dwarfs hate Orcs and Goblins.
See the psychology section of the Mordheim rules for details
on the effects of hatred.
Grudgebearers: Dwarfs hold an ancient grudge against
Elves from the days when the two races fought for supremacy
in the Old World. A Dwarf warband may never include any
kind of Elven Hired Sword or Dramatis Personae.
Incomparable Miners: Dwarfs spend much of their lives
underground searching for precious minerals, and they are the
best in the world at this kind of work. In the city of
Mordheim they apply similar skills to the search for
wyrdstone. When checking for wyrdstone at the end of a
game, add +1 to the number of pieces found for a Dwarf
warband.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral

##### Choice of warriors

```
A Dwarf warband must include a minimum of 3 models. You
have 500 gold crowns which you can use to recruit and equip

Noble: Each Dwarf warband must have one Noble – no
more, no less!

of the weapon by 3. For rules on Gromril weapons see the
Mordheim rulebook. Note that this price is only for a starting
warband, as it represents the Dwarfs outfitting themselves at
their own stronghold. Later purchases of Gromril weapons
are done using the price chart in the Mordheim rules.
**The price of a suit of Gromril armour is cheaper for a
starting warband to represent the relative ease with which
Dwarfs can find such items in their own stronghold. Later
purchases of Gromril armour must be done using the normal
price chart in the Mordheim rules.

#### Dwarf Rangers

From the Nemesis Crown
‘Old’ Borin was respected and revered amongst his contemporaries as he had outlived the majority of them and grown the beard to prove it.
He was used to reverence. Yet there was more to it than simple age, even in Dwarf Society where that carried a great deal of respect. He was
also a member of the Order of Runesmiths, it’s rites and rituals secretive and powerful.
Now, as he struck the axe blade, forging another ancient rune into its surface, uttering the words of power that would enhance the potency of
the weapon, Borin knew that each new runic item produced by him and his peers was another step in repairing the mistakes of the past.
Staring at the finished axe, the Runesmith felt a surge of pride, but fought it back. Yes the weapon was complete and empowered, but it was
no better than any produced now. Not compared to the great weapons forged in the Old Times and wielded in the hands of the greatest
heroes of his people. Only by locating the fabled weapons of the past and studying their runes could his people usher in a new Golden Age.
He and his fellow Runesmiths would not repeat the mistakes of the past...the new items of power that would be produced would be powerful,
and without flaw.

##### Special Rules

Hard to Kill: Dwarfs are tough, resilient individuals who can
only be taken out of action on a roll of 6 instead of 5-6 when

game, add +1 to the number of pieces found for a Dwarf

Don’t Trust ‘Em: While Ranger Warbands are free to ally
with other Dwarf warbands in multi-player games, their point
of view is so different that they do not trust them fully.
Members of a Dwarf Rangers warband are never considered
‘friendly models’ to other dwarfs and vice versa.
This means that members of one warband WILL stop
members of the other from running, they won’t keep each
other from taking All Alone tests, etc. They don’t count as
enemy models and may split any treasure found at the end of
the game as normal, but the two bands are not friends, make
no mistake!

* - Any weapon a Dwarf may normally purchase may be
purchased as a Gromril weapon instead. This multiplies the
cost of the weapon by three. For rules on Gromril weapons
see the Mordheim rulebook. Note that this price is only for a
starting warband, as it represents the Dwarfs outfitting
themselves at their own stronghold. Later purchases of
Gromril weapons are done using the Price Charts in the
Mordheim rulebook.
** - The price of a suit of Gromril armour is cheaper for a
starter warband to represent the relative ease with which
Dwarfs can find such items in their own stronghold. Later
purchases of Gromril Armour must be done using the normal
Price Chart in the Mordheim rulebook.

1 Runesmith
85 gold crowns to hire
Dwarf Runesmiths are champions of the old ways. ‘If it was good
enough for my ancestors, it’s good enough for me!’ is a popular
saying. Fresh out of their decades-long apprenticeships, these
Runesmiths are normally on a quest to prove this saying and so will
gather together a party of like-minded individuals to seek out lost
treasures of their ancestors to confirm this adherence to the
traditional ways. The quest for an item like the Nemesis Crown is a
dream come true for a young Runesmith (not to mention many of a
more advanced age!).
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

3 5 4 3 4 1 2 1 10
Weapons/Armour: A Dwarf Runesmith may be equipped
with weapons and armour chosen from the Dwarf Warrior
equipment list.
Skills: The Dwarf Runesmith may choose from Combat,
Shooting, Academic & Strength when he gains a new skill. In
addition, the Dwarf Runesmith may choose from the Dwarf
Special Skill list.
Special Rules
Leader: Any warrior within 6” of the Dwarf Runesmith may
use his leadership characteristic when taking any Leadership
tests.

```
Inscribe Runes: A Runesmith knows one minor rune (see
list at the end of this warband list), determined randomly
when the warband is first created. He may inscribe the rune
on an item carried by one of the warriors of his warband, and
(if successful, see below) the item will gain a bonus from the
rune for that game. When a Runesmith advances and rolls a
skill on the Hero Advance table, he may choose to learn a
new rune instead of learning a skill (exactly like a spell caster
advancing and learning a new spell).
```
```
0-1 Apprentice Runesmith
40 gold crowns to hire
An Apprentice Runesmith follows his master wherever he goes and
is normally just as anxious to prove that the old ways are best. For

Extra Set of Hands: An Apprentice Runesmith helps his
master fashion runic items, doing all the boring grunge-work
that makes his master more efficient in his efforts. An
Apprentice Runesmith in the warband allows a Master
Runesmith to inscribe on two items before each game,
instead of only one.

0-2 Troll Slayer
50 gold crowns to hire
While it may seem that Troll Slayers shouldn’t fit in with the rest of
a Ranger warband, make no mistake – they are strict adherents to
tradition and the old ways! Indeed they usually find it easier to get
along with the more traditional minded Dwarfs than other dwarfs,
who Slayers feel lack determination and the insight to see what the
true problems are with their race. Besides, on a perilous quest such
as this, the opportunities to achieve a death of legendary fame and
fulfil the Slayer Oath are too great to ignore.

Dwarf Clansman

There are many Dwarfs who see the ‘wisdom’ in reliance on the old

0-5 Dwarf Ranger

Dwarf Rangers are the hunters and trailblazers of Dwarf society.

wide-open spaces, Rangers are the perfect candidates to participate
in a mission such as this.

Beardling
25 gold crowns to hire
Many of the proponents of the old ways are older members of Dwarf
community. However there are still youngsters who believe and they
often accompany a Runic warband to lend a hand as needed to the
respected oldsters. More spry than their fellows, they are often used
as scouts, roaming ahead with the Rangers to spy the land and
observe enemy activity.

everything in their long careers and they know it. They are
used to fighting by themselves against impossible odds and it
hasn’t killed them yet. On top of all this they are just
generally more set in their ways than other Dwarfs and
they’re not about to let a bunch of weedy goblins drive them
off! A Dwarf Longbeard may reroll any failed Leadership test
he is required to take. Remember that you can never reroll a
reroll, so the result of this second roll must always be
accepted.

##### Dwarf Runes

Runesmiths harness the magic of the Warhammer world by
inscribing magical runes on items, imbuing them with a
variety of wondrous abilities. When a Runesmith graduates
from his long apprenticeship he has knowledge of one or two
minor runes taught to him by his master. These runes are less
powerful than normal Dwarf runes, in that they can only
utilise magic for a short time. As the Runesmith practises and
studies on his own, he gains the knowledge required to
inscribe the more powerful permanent runes on to items.
Before each game, the Runesmith may attempt to inscribe the
rune on an item one of the warriors in his warband is
carrying. To do so he must roll 2D6. If he rolls a number
equal to or greater than the Difficulty Level of the rune, the
item gains the appropriate bonus FOR THAT GAME. If he
rolls a ‘2’ on the 2D6, he has fumbled the inscription,
fractured the blade of the weapon or shattered the breastplate
of the armour, etc. The item is destroyed and must be
removed from the warrior’s list of items, though it may be
replaced before the game if the warband has sufficient gold
crowns. Any other failure simply means the Runesmith failed
to inscribe the rune correctly and the warrior gains no bonus.
The leader of a Dwarf Rangers warband represents a younger
Runesmith that has recently left the tutelage of his master. He
knows one of the following minor runes:

```
D6 Result
1 Rune of Stone Difficulty 8.
+1 to Armour Save.
2 Rune of Sharpness Difficulty 6.
-1 Armour Save modifier to weapon.
3 Rune of Speed Difficulty 7.
Initiative doubled on weapon
4 Rune of Warding Difficulty 8.
Special 4+ save Vs. Spells affecting target (placed on
belt, armband, etc. Cost to replace: 1 GC).
5 Rune of Accuracy Difficulty 9.
+1 to hit on weapon.
6 Rune of Striding Difficulty 8.
+1 Movement (placed on boots, belt, etc. Cost to
replace: 1 GC).
The Jealousy of Runes: Bonuses from Runes are not
cumulative with magical bonuses from other items. In other
words, a warrior may not combine a Rune of Stone on his
shield and a Rune of Shield on his armour for a total bonus to
his Armour Save of +2. Similarly the warrior could not
combine the Rune of Stone on his shield with some suit of
magic elven armour (for example) that added +1 to the
warrior’s Armour Save.

#### Von Carstein Warband

Count Vlad von Carstein and his wife Isabella have ruled the
province of Sylvania for as long as anyone can remember –
peasants whisper of some dark secret, Witch Hunters revile
them, and the Priests of Sigmar shun their court. Indeed,
Sylvania has the most dire reputation of all the provinces of
the Empire. Few men sent to spy on the rulers of Sylvania
have ever returned from those dark Sylvanian forests, and then
rarely with their sanity intact.
In the dimly-lit chamber of the Drakenhof castle, on a throne
of black obsidian, sits Vlad von Carstein, the ruler of Sylvania.
He waits in shadows, having set himself apart from the politics
and bickering of the Empire. For he holds a terrible secret: he,
and all the ruling aristocracy of his province are Vampires,
undying monsters from beyond the grave. Here he patiently
waits, drinking the blood of maidens from gold goblets.
For many long years Vlad has gathered his strength and
mustered his Undead legions in secrecy. One day soon he will
march from the forests of Sylvania at the head of an army of
restless dead. The pieces of magic stone that lie scattered
among the ruins of Mordheim can give the Count the power to
challenge the nobles of the Empire and enslave the men of the
Old World.
Wyrdstone holds enough captured magical energy to unleash a
great spell of doom to rival that of Nagash the Black. If the
Count is successful, he will raise all the dead between the
Worlds Edge Mountains and the borders of Stirland, and go to
war against the divided rulers of the Empire. His plans laid
out, Vlad sends his thralls, the immortal Vampires, to do his
bidding.
During dark, moonless nights, black coaches arrive at the
gates of Mordheim carrying coffins. Ghouls scuttle from their
hiding places to greet them, and corpses are stirred by a
command which the living cannot hear. Following the
commands of the Vampire, they hunt for shards of wyrdstone.
The night belongs to the Undead, and in Mordheim it is
always night.

##### Special Rules

```
Habituation: Vampires' human servants rapidly have to
become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Master (or
Mistresses) and their undead minions. The human members of
a Von Carstein warband are immune to fear caused by types of
undead in their own warband, ie: skeletons, wights, vampires,
etc. Other types of undead cause fear as normal.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.

An Undead warband must include a minimum of three models.
You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your warband. The

Although but pale shadows when compared to the dread Vampire

Necromancers are evil wizards, studying the corrupt art of
Necromancy. Many of them are acolytes and servants of Vlad von

0-3 Dregs
20 gold crowns to hire
Dregs are the most miserable human survivors of the demise of
Mordheim. They are deformed and rejected individuals, shunned
even by the other men and women who still live in the ruins and
catacombs of the city.
Vampires often recruit Dregs as their servants and treat them with
surprising kindness. As a result, Dregs are often fanatically loyal to
their Undead overlords and will do anything to protect and serve
them.
Dregs are very useful to their masters as they can be sent to buy
equipment, weapons and supplies from the settlements around
Mordheim which would often not welcome Necromancers or where
Vampires would fall under the suspicion of the Witch Hunters. They
can also do the bidding of their vampiric master during daylight,
when the Vampires must rest in their coffins.

150 gold crowns to hire
The Undead Troll is a construct created by a necromancer using
both Dark magic and arcane science. The Necromancer then applies
his knowledge of science and magic to bring this creature to a state
of semi-life. This is a long and drawn out process, which involves a
fair amount of maintenance, so the Necromancer may only maintain
one Undead Troll at a time.

Ghouls are the descendants of evil and insane men who ate the flesh

the Old World, the most depraved and destitute took to feasting on
corpses to survive.
Driven by their unspeakable craving for the meat of their fellow
men, these creatures have given up their human life and dwell near
graveyards, crypts and tombs, digging up the rotting corpses of the
recently buried and consuming the cold flesh with their bare teeth
and claws.
The destruction of Mordheim attracted many Ghoul clans from the
north, and now they have taken up permanent residence in the
crypts and cemeteries of the ruined city.

Dire Wolves are slavering Undead hounds, the animated remains of
the giant wolves of the Worlds Edge Mountains. Their chilling howls

Even in death there is no rest for the fallen warriors, for they can be
summoned back to the world of the living by black sorcery. All that
these once-dead fighters can recall of their mortal life are faint
memories of battles fought long ago. All that they feel is the
compulsion to fight and to obey their masters as they did when they
were alive. A mortal who dares fight against an army of Skeletons is
confronted by a ghastly apparition, for who could remain unafraid
when faced with the remains of long-dead warriors lurching
towards him?

#### Lahmian Warband

This warband was based on one created by the Khemri guys, [http://grafixgibs.tripod.com/Khemri/index.htm.](http://grafixgibs.tripod.com/Khemri/index.htm.)
Long ago, the nobles of Lahmia stole the secret of the elixir of eternal life from the Great Necromancer, Nagash, during the
war in which he was expelled from the land of Nehekhara. Over time, corrupted by the secret they had stolen, they became the
first true vampires and were themselves driven out. Banished from their ancestral home, the Lahmians became mistresses of
seduction and cunning, indulging their hedonistic appetites through manipulation of lesser wills. Of all the great vampire
bloodlines, the Lahmians above all have become most adept at exploiting that great weakness of humanity, the desire for love,
power and an escape from death. Their poor, deluded followers do their bidding by night and protect them by day. Their
interest in humanity (if interest is the right word to use of what are, after all, merely instruments and playthings) has made
them strong. Now, centuries after they were dispossessed, Nehekhara is once again a land of the dead, and the Lahmian
vampires have returned from the Northlands to reclaim their own. In the North, they have learned how to bend humans to their
will. In their ancestral home they have older, more faithful servants who, dormant through the centuries, have awaited their
return.

##### Special Rules

Blood Successor: Unlike the Vampire warband, Lahmia
warbands may not recruit a new vampire if the warband
contains a Blood Sister. Instead, if the Lahmia is slain then
the Blood Sister may transform into a Vampire during the
post-battle experience phase. Until that happens the surviving
human henchmen with highest leadership (or, in the case of a
tie, the most experience) will assume leadership of the
warband until the Blood Sister transforms. If the warband
does not contain a Blood Sister then leadership is allocated as
above and a new vampire may be recruited after the next
battle. If during the post-battle phase the warband contains
neither a vampire nor a necromancer either because they have
been killed or never recruited, then any skeletons and wight
henchmen in the warband are lost as the magic which
sustains them is dispelled.
Habituation: Vampires' human servants rapidly have to
become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Mistresses
and their undead minions. The human members of an Lahmia
warband are immune to fear caused by types of undead in
their own warband, i.e: skeletons, wights, vampires, etc.
Other types of undead cause fear as normal.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Choice of Warriors

```
A Lahmian warband must consist of at least three models.
You have 500gc to recruit and equip your initial warband.
The maximum number of warriors in the warband may never
exceed 15.
Lahmia Vampire: Each Lahmian Warband must have one
Lahmia Vampire no more, no less!
Necromancer: Your warband may have up to one
Necromancer.
Thrall: Your warband may have up to three Thrall.
Blood Sister: Your warband may include up to one Blood
Sister, but he can only be taken instead of a Thrall.
Beloved: Your warband may include up to one Beloved, but
he can only be taken instead of a Thrall.
Skeletons: Your warband may include any number of
Skeletons.
Blood Slaves: Your warband may have up to five Blood
Slaves.
Dire Wolves: Your warband may have up to five Dire
Wolves.
```
##### Starting Experience

```
The Lahmia Vampire starts with 20 Experience.
Necromancer starts with 8 Experience.
Blood sister, Thrall & all henchmen start with 0

side of a direct line to the Lahmia. If the vampire is taken out
of action, the Beloved will immediately hate the model who
did the damage and attempt to kill them at the earliest
opportunity. The beloved will remain frenzied until the hated
enemy is slain.
Favoured: If the Lahmia's Beloved is killed, she may choose
one of her Thralls to replace him by granting him the Blood
Kiss at his next advance. If this option is taken the Thralls'
leadership is increased to 8 if not already so and he takes the
place of the Beloved in the warband's roster. The Thrall's
elevation to Beloved counts instead of any advance he may
be entitled to. A new Thrall may be recruited after the
warband's next battle.

being all alone.
Demi-Vampires: If the warband's Lahmia is killed, the
Blood Sister may take her place. At her next advance she will
become a vampire on a roll of 4+ on a d6. This counts instead
of the advance. The blood Sister retains her existing skills
and experience but the usual rules for undead apply
immediately and her maximum stats become those of a
vampire. If the Blood Sister fails to transform, roll again at
her next and all subsequent advances. Once a Blood Sister
has become a vampire a new Blood Sister may be recruited
into the warband after the next game.

```
0-1 Beloved
Lahmians are attracted to mortals of strong will and strong body.
Their seduction gives the vampires a special pleasure, and their
martial skills are evermore devoted to the will of their dark mistress.
Until, that is, she grows tired of them or finds a more interesting
lover...
Beloved: The Beloved maybe chosen from any hero in a
human warband other then Middenheim, Witch Hunters,
Sisters of Sigmar, Possessed, Carnival of Chaos and any hero

#### Tilean Warband

The land of Tilea is home to some of the most wealthy and
aloof people in the Old World. A land that is divided by its
own competition of trade and separated by personal feuds and
warring city-states. It is civic pride and a desire for financial
status that drives each and every Tilean. To this end, the
Tileans have become proficient sailors and explorers. They
set sail for all ports in the Old World and drop anchor off the
shores of far distant lands in search of gold and precious
artefacts that can often bring a hefty price in any market of
the world.
Tilean warbands are often hired to explore the steamy
jungles, hot deserts or even the ruined city like Mordheim
either by their patron city-state or by wealthy merchants or
guilds. There are many city-states in Tilea to base a
warband’s history on although only the most prominent three
will be dealt with here. You can create a pirate warband
hailing from Sartosa or a warband of acolytes of the patron
god Lucan from Luccini if you so desire. Whatever warband
suites your fancy you’ll find that the land of Tilea is rich with
history to base it upon. You’ll also find a Tilean warband to
be structured much like the mercenary warbands but there are
subtle differences that reflect the rich Tilean history.

##### Miragleans

The Miragleans are deadly accurate with the city’s official
weapon, the crossbow. Therefore Miraglean Heroes have a
+1 to hit when using crossbows only. Marksmen get a +1 to
hit with any missile weapon they use (this is included in the
marksmen’s profile). All Miragleans have a deep-seated
hatred toward Skaven. This dates back to the red pox
outbreak of 1812 when three quarters of the population of the
city perished. When fighting Skaven a Miraglean warband
will be affected by the rules for Hatred towards them. Hired
swords are not affected by the Hatred rule.
Hired Swords: Miragleans warband cannot have Skaven
Hired Swords.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Remasens

In 1487 a fleet of Dark Elf warships invaded the coastal city
of Remas and ever since the people of that city have a deep
dislike of the Druchii. A warband from Remas will fight to
the death against any Dark Elf warband they encounter. To
represent this, the Remasen player is allowed to re-roll any
rout test one time and must abide by the second roll. This
only applies when fighting Dark Elves. Remasen officers are
steadfast individuals whose years of training have afforded
them excellent leadership. The leadership value of a Remasen
captain, champion and young blood are always one point
higher regardless of whom they are fighting.
Hired Swords: Remasens warband cannot have Dark Elf
Hired Swords.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Trantios

```
A warband hailing from Trantio will be the best-equipped
and most experienced human warband in Lustria. To
represent this a Trantio war band will always start a one-off
match with an extra 100 GC and in a Lustrian campaign they
will start with an extra 20% GC added to their total.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.
```
##### Choice of Warriors

```
Your warband must include a minimum of 3 models to a
maximum of 15 models. You have 500 points to assemble
your warband with. The maximum characteristics for each
type will be the same as any Mordheim mercenary warband.
Captain: Each Tilean Warband must have one Captain to
lead it – no more, no less.
Champion: Your Warband may include up to two
Champions.
Youngbloods: Your Warband may include up to two
Youngbloods.

#### Outlaw Warband

To the north of the River Stir lies the Great Forest, a vast
expanse of woodland that fills the very heart of the Empire.
Bounded along its southern edge by the river, this, the largest
forest of the known world, extends league upon league as far
as any man can see. Just at its southernmost, the River Stir
separates a small part of the forest from the main bulk of the
woodland and this smaller area of forest is known locally as
Stirwood. Small though Stirwood may be – indeed, this part
of the forest is not even on the same scale as the sacred Forest
of Loren, but, as many say, size isn’t everything – Stirwood
Forest is nevertheless still large enough to get lost in, and
many have done so, some by accident and some by design.
Stirwood lies just north of the noble city of Nuln and to the
west of Wurtbad, where law and order are strictly enforced,
at least they are strictly enforced once the City Guards have
finally managed to catch up with those who break the
Count’s law. The Elector Count of Stirland was well known
as a man that one should not cross. Those that did so were
inevitably declared as ‘outlaws’ and were pursued from the
cities. Even the most petty of criminals, some still quite
young, could be declared ‘outlaw’ and had little option but to
flee to the countryside. Many perished, both young and old,
but some made it to Stirwood where they could lay low.
During their time in Stirwood, some would band together and
become groups of outlaws, rather than just attempting to
survive on their own. The forest was a perfect training ground
to develop their skills, particularly in archery, where even the
hunting of the wild deer, the Count’s deer, was a crime in
itself. Illicit deer-hunting was not their only past-time as
many an unwary traveller, passing unsuspectingly through
the forest, would find themselves ambushed and relieved of
their goods.
Monks also lived in these parts, holy men who spent their
time in devotion to the blessed Sigmar. Usually they dwelt
alone in contemplation, but were often trusted by the local
groups of outlaws that they came into contact with and
attended to their spiritual needs, and, when the occasion
arose, also attended to their wounds.

```
In the years that followed the sighting of the twin-tailed star
in the sky, it was inevitable that tales of Mordheim would
have travelled down the waters of the River Stir. Tales of
strange sights and great riches would easily have reached the
inhabitants of Stirwood Forest. Temptations of this enormous
wealth that was rumoured to be in the shattered city would
have been hard for any group of outlaws to resist.
```
##### Special Rules

```
All warriors in an Outlaws warband may be equipped with
only one missile weapon at any time. All warriors must carry
a type of bow, but not crossbows, as part of their equipment.
So, even if an Outlaw acquires skills that allow him to use
additional ballistic weaponry, he cannot do so. The only
exception to this is the Monk who may choose to carry a

#### Pit Fighter Warband

All across the world you can find gladiatorial pit fights, here
you can find hardy fighters taking up arms against each other.
From the vicious pits of Cutthroat’s Haven to the Black Pits
surrounding Mordheim there can be heard the clash of steel.
In most places local law itself bans these fights, but the
culture itself remains a haven for ex-mercenaries, escaped
convicts and itinerant conmen and bribes to local officials
ensures that this brutal sport continues unabated.
There are as many different type of fight as there are venues,
from small fistfights in an old barn or a back alley to huge
conflicts with many heavily armed combatants. Most fighters
are slaves who work for the so-called ‘circuit’. They try to
earn their freedom by paying off their owners with a large cut
of the winnings. Most successful Pit Fighters live for the
sport (and of course often die for it also!) because they know
of little else.
The men in this Warband consist solely of professional Pit
Fighters who were either able to buy their freedom or have
escaped. Now they roam the streets of Mordheim in search
for the Wyrdstone that would bring them wealth faster than
anyone can imagine.
The Pit Fighters are used to fighting in streets and small
corridors and this makes them a much-feared opponent. The
Pit King is the most skilled and cunning Pit Fighter of them
all who leads his band with an iron fist.
Appearance: Pit Fighters are grizzled veteran warriors
covered with many scars of battle, they are armed with
special Pit Weapons and Armour, their bodies well developed
and muscular. They wear little clothing and only partial
armour known as Pit Armour.

##### Special Rules

All Pit Fighters have the Pit Fighter skill as described in the
Strength Skill List except the Pit Fighter Initiates. (Pit Fighter
Skill: +1 WS, +1 A when fighting in ruins, buildings and The
Pit.)
Free the Slaves!: Pit Fighters hate all Slavers. The Pit
Fighters will never sell their captured opponents to the
slavers.
In the Pit!: Pit Fighters who capture an opponent may decide
to let him fight in the infamous fighting pits of Cutthroat’s
Haven.
The Pit Fighter Warband may decide to send in one or more
of their own fighters to fight the captive, if the Pit Fighter
wins he gains +2 Experience, the Warband gets all the
Captive’s armour and weapons +50gc, if the Pit Fighter loses
then roll to see whether he is dead or injured as normal
(ignore all following results: Robbed, Captured, Hardened,
Sold to the Pits and Survives Against the Odds), he will not
lose his armour or weapons, the Captive will get the 50 GC
and the +2 Experience when he wins. If the Captive wins the
audience decides whether he gains his freedom. Roll a D6 on
a 4+ the audience raise their thumbs and he is free. A 1-3
means he remains the Pit Fighters Captive and may be fielded
in the pits after future games
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Choice of Warriors

A Pit Fighter Warband must include a minimum of 3 models.

Troll Slayers are members of the morbid Dwarf cult obsessed with
seeking an honourable death in combat. Having committed some
unforgivable crime or been dishonoured in some way, a Dwarf will
forsake his home and wander off to die fighting the enemies of
Dwarf kind. Troll Slayers are insanely dangerous individuals,
psychopathic and violent. There are, however, few better fighters in
the Known World, so which place would be more fitting for them

rolling on the injury chart. Treat a roll of 1-2 as knocked

Hard Head: Dwarfs ignores the special rules for maces,
clubs, etc. They are not easy to knock out!
Hate Orcs and Goblins: All Dwarfs hate Orcs and Goblins.
See the psychology section of the Mordheim rules for details
on the effects of hatred.
Grudgebearers: Dwarfs hold an ancient grudge against
Elves from the days when the two races fought for the
supremacy of the Old World. If the Pit Fighters ever hire any
kind of Elven Hired Sword he will leave the Warband
immediately, he refuses to fight alongside these pansy Elves!

#### Norse Warband

O’ Sigmar preserve us from the wrath of the Norsemen’
The land of Norsca lies to the far north of the Empire across
the stormy sea of Claws. This is a harsh land of snow and ice
with mountains of Frost and Dusk that reach unto the heavens
themselves and march right down to the sea. The humans that
live here are powerfully built, with large, well muscled
frames and long limbs. The Norse are a bloodthirsty people
whose society is based entirely around war and fighting.
They make or produce very little in their inhospitable
homeland and their attitude is to take whatever they need
from the lands of others. Many a time their dreaded longships
have brought terror and destruction to the lands of men and
the other races. The Norse people live in marauder tribes or
clans much like the Unberogens who were, centuries earlier,
the founders of the Empire. It is for these reasons that the
Norse are seen as a very primitive and uncivilised race by
others and indeed many Norse tribes openly worship the dark
gods of Chaos as their own.
All Norse warriors are trained in the art of war at a very
young age and become skilled in the use of sword, axe and
shield for their’s is a brutal society where only the strongest
survive. Probably because of their well founded fearsome
reputation the Norsemen have few allegiances apart from to
their clan and their ancestors and so make excellent
mercenaries.
Despite their brutish behaviour the Norse make superb
natural sailors rivalling even the High Elves and it was
indeed the Norse who were the first humans to discover
Lustria and the South Lands. In their longships, the Norse
sailed from the Old World to Lustria, establishing the first
colony, Skeggi. The Norse plague the coast of Lustria raiding
many coastal settlements but it is their desire for riches and
saga that have driven them further inland to pillage the
temples of the Slann.

##### Special Rules

```
All Norse Warriors are subject to the following special rules:
Seamen: The Norse are a sea faring people and spend much
of their time rowing boats. To represent this, all Norse
warriors get +2 to Strength when trying to row a boat.

following: Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

#### Dark Elf Warband

Dark Ones of Naggaroth Many dare not speak of the High
Elves’ evil kin, the Druchii, or the Dark Elves as they are
better known. They are a race for whom pain and pleasure
have been pushed to the ultimate extreme. They leave
destruction and despair in their wake and are more greatly
feared than the barbaric Orcs and no less so than the tainted
forces of Chaos and Undeath. To the victims of the Dark
Elves it is the fortunate to whom a quick death is gifted for
this twisted folk roam the Known World in search of slaves.
The slaves of the Dark Elves are either worked to death in
their mines, ripped apart on the altars to Khaine, their dark
God, or tortured mercilessly by the Brides of Khaine, the
Witch Elves. Dark Elves take a perverse delight in inflicting
pain upon others just to see their victims suffer.
Despite their dire reputation for cruelty they are only rivalled
as explorers and adventurers by their High Elven cousins. It
is the lure of the precious, arcane artefacts of the Slann that
bring these foul creatures to Lustria, travelling stealthily in
their Black Arks and penetrating deep into the jungle. Dark
Elves are adept at stealth and ambush and are well suited to
the overgrown realm of the Lizardmen – most warbands
don’t even know they’re being attacked until it is too late.

##### Heroes

1 High Born
70 Gold Crowns to hire
Dark Elf Leaders are typically drawn from the Dark Elf nobility and
lead the warband in search of gold, slaves and arcane artefacts to
bring home to Naggaroth. They are cold and ruthless killers and
they command the respect of their troops through assassination and
terror. They have attained their position of leadership by
eliminating rival nobles who stand in their way and through their
remarkable cunning, they are dangerous foes who embody the
merciless traits of the Druchii race.

Griffons and other noble creatures their malevolent kin have
infamous Beastmasters, Dark Elves of particularly cruel renown

Dark Elves are strange in that apart from the fell Witch King there
are no other male sorcerers, all the other practitioners of magic in
the Dark Elf race are female. It is rumoured that any males who do
develop an affinity for magic amongst the Dark Elves are
immediately put to death to fulfil some dark prophecy. Dark Elf
Sorceresses are mysterious, raven haired beauties who are

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Corsairs
35 Gold Crowns to hire
The Dark Elves are cruel and fierce fighters. This is especially true
of the Corsairs – the Black Ark Raiders. They are skilled with sword
and axe, as well as the repeater crossbow, the distinct missile
weapon of the Dark Elves. Whenever a Black Ark explores the coast
of Lustria the Corsairs are the first to launch raiding parties.

0-5 Shades
30 Gold Crowns to hire
The stealthy Dark Elf Scouts rely on their repeater crossbows to
harass and snipe at the enemy, rather than engaging them head on
as ambush is the preferred style of fighting. Shades are young and
inexperienced scouts that see the expeditions to Lustria as a
valuable training opportunity.

is Hiding, enemy models suffer -1 to their Initiative value for
determining if they can detect him.

```
0-2 Cold One Beasthounds
30 Gold Crowns to hire
The Dark Elves capture and breed many exotic creatures to fight for
them and fights between pets are often staged as a form of
entertainment amongst the Dark Elves. One such animal was
discovered in Lustria. Distantly related to Cold Ones, the Cold One
Beasthound lives in swamps and bogs. Cold One Beasthounds are
larger than war dogs and of similar build but are in all other
respects reptilian. Rows of sharp teeth fill its maw, and when
provoked, the Cold One Beasthound is a very aggressive beast. The
Dark Elves capture and train these creatures to fight in battles all
over the Warhammer world.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
6 3 0 4 4 1 1 1 4
Weapons/Armour: Cold One Beasthounds are animals and
do not need any weapons save their claws and massive jaws.
Special Rules
Animals: Cold One Beasthounds are animals and all animal
rules apply to them, they never gain experience.
Beastmaster: Cold One Beasthounds are nasty viscous
brutes that are barely kept under control. If the Beastmaster
dies the beasts will immediately escape from the warband and
they are removed from the warband roster. If the Beastmaster
is unable to participate in a battle, then neither will the beasts.
Stupidity: Cold One Beasthounds may use the basic
Leadership of the Beastmaster if they are within 6" of him.
They may never use the Leadership of the warband leader,
nor may they benefit from the Beastmaster’s increased
Leadership if he is within 6" of the leader.
Scaly Skin: Cold One Beasthounds have tough scaly skin,
and are considered to have a 6+ armour save. This save
cannot be modified beyond 6 due to strength modifiers but
any result of ‘no save’ on the injury chart will negate the
unmodified 6+ save.
Fear: Cold One Beasthounds cause Fear.

#### Clan Eshin

Unbeknownst to man, for thousands of years he has shared
his world with another and altogether different race. There
have always been signs for those who cared to see them: a
scurrying black shadow, an inhuman scream from the sewer,
scuttling shapes at the back of the cellar. All these years these
creatures have worked away in secret, burrowing beneath the
world of man, undermining his great cities, infiltrating his
sewers and cellars, and joining all up into a vast world
spanning labyrinth of tunnels and nests. These creatures call
themselves Skaven and they are ratmen, the mutant spawn of
an older age of chaos and mutation.
Doubtless one day the Skaven will be ready to emerge from
their tunnels and wage open war upon mankind. For centuries
they have been content to feed upon his ruins, to seed plague
in his cities, and spread contagion amongst his lands. At least
they were content to wait and watch, for now everything has
suddenly changed. Now the destruction of Mordheim has
created new opportunities in the secret war against mankind.
Since ancient times the Skaven have searched the world for
the stones of power that men in their ignorance call
wyrdstone but which Skaven have long since known as
warpstone, blackstone, or seerstone. It was as a result of
gnawing upon this magic stone in ages past that
commonplace rats began the slow process of mutation that
spawned the Skaven race. Wyrdstone is quite literally in their
blood, for they feed upon it and make use of it in their foul
sorceries. Until now the ratmen’s search for wyrdstone has
been difficult and time-consuming as the stone has grown
increasingly rare, but now a new and abundant source has
appeared – a dark blessing from the skies!
For the Skaven of Clan Eshin, this is an especially opportune
time for such a thing to happen, for, just as the Empire is
divided, so the Skaven race is divided amongst itself. Clan
fights clan the world over, each struggling for domination of
the Council of Thirteen whose masters rule the Skaven race.
Mordheim’s secret is not yet revealed to all the clans, or else
the City of the Damned would already be overrun with
ratmen. The Nightmaster of Clan Eshin is keen to guard this
secret, and for this reason has not sent his multitudinous
armies into Mordheim. Instead, he has sent small warbands of
Skaven skittering through secret tunnels into the city to

```
gather up the shining stones and bring them back to the clan
nests.
The Skaven of Clan Eshin are supremely adapted to their
task. Masters of the art of bringing silent death to their foes,
they are skilled in the use of poison and trained in the
thousand secrets of the assassin. Since birth Skaven warriors
practise martial crafts in the ruinous temples of the Horned
Rat, their ever hungering and hideous god. There are none
better amongst their verminous kind to gather up the treasure
of Mordheim, but they must be silent, swift and efficient.
Were rival Skaven clans to discover the secret of Mordheim
there would come not hundreds, not thousands, but millions
upon millions to contend for the wyrdstone in the City of the
Damned.

#### Clan Moulder

This warband was based from the Skaven Warbands by Michael Hulsander
To the north, in the blasted wasteland known as the Troll
Country, lie the infernal breeding pits of Clan Moulder. Their
stronghold is burrowed into the walls and floor of a ragged
chasm in a snowy mountainside in the northern spur of the
Worlds Edge Mountains. Volcanic pools at the bottom of the
chasm raise a greyish plume of steam and vapours over it and
mix the stink of sulphur with the stench of matted fur and
excrement carried on the wind. Worse than the stench is the
dreadful cacophony of howls, squawks, screams, snarls and
shrieks which clamour out of the frozen chasm like the
wailing, lost souls of a thousand different races. It is not
without good reason that this place is known as the Hell Pit.
Clan Moulder is constantly seeking new, stable breeds of
fighting beasts that they can sell or hire to the other clans.
Small bands of Packmasters scour the lands around Hell Pit
for creatures to capture for their diabolic experimentation.
Chaos monsters from the Northern Wastes are the most
dangerous but also the most valuable by far. Huge and
monstrous creatures always offer the best chance to create a
new breed of fighting beasts. Clan Moulder hunters will trail
a Manticore or Hydra for months waiting for an opportunity
to strike. Captured beasts are hauled away into Hell Pit in
great iron cages. Once in the pit they are exposed to
Warpstone and fed on carefully measured amounts of it until
the desired mutations start to form. Rumours abound of the
crossbred monstrosities they have created of which the
fearsome Rat Ogre is undoubtedly the most infamous. Rat-
like wolves have also been seen prowling in Kislev, along
with curious furred breeds of troll and huge, seldom-seen
burrowing creatures. Some of the beasts the Packmasters
catch are simply trained and sold to other clans. Clan
Moulder Packmasters are experts in training wild and vicious
monsters. Truculent beasts are broken so that they obey and
passive creatures goaded until they become killers. The
bottom of Hell Pit is filled with the detritus of the clan's
failed experiments: pale twisted monstrosities that shamble or

```
flop across the floor of the chasm and feed on one another.
Clan Moulder is the clan with the most experience and
knowledge about the effects of Warpstone, possible with the
exception of the Order of Grey Seers.

strength of a canine. The Wolf Rats are the same size and
build as a wolf but with hairless legs that end in rat like
claws, a rat's head and a rat tail. In addition they often have
hideous mutations such as an extra head, abnormal bone
growth or insect like tails. Those that truly lupines are kept in
spiked cages and fed on their own dead, so that when they are
finally unleashed into the outside world they attack anything
in their path in a blood rage.

#### Clan Pestilens

Jarod glanced down the street... All seemed clear. He could not immediately tell why, but he was sure someone, or something was there.
Maybe it was just that strange odour hanging around the ruins here. He shivered, although Mordheim seemed to have its own special smell,
this made him think of death.
A sudden noise made him jump up and bring his crossbow to bear on the still empty street. A strange mist started to creep in and soft
squeaks could be made out. As Jarod sounded the alarm, two figures rushed towards him. Dressed in tattered cloaks, they wielded what
looked like a spiked censer. Almost suffocating in the bellowing smoke, he fired his crossbow. Then, just before the spiked smoking ball
smashed his skull, he saw two red gleaming eyes in a disease ridden skaven face.
In the Old World sickness and plague are a fact of life and
many people blame rats for spreading contagion. They are
more right than they know.
Clan Pestilens exist to spread plague and pestilence through
their foul rites and experiments. They have been chosen by
the Horned Rat himself as his Disciples of Decay and are
responsible for more deaths than any other clan, mainly due
to the plagues and diseases they have unleashed on the cities
and empires in the Old World. The main strongholds of Clan
Pestilens consist of captured Slann temple-cities in the humid
jungles of Lustria and a mighty stronghold in the southlands.
They also have their own quarter in Skavenblight,
maintaining their position as one of the most powerful clans
in the Skaven Under-Empire.
Plague Monks favour knives and staffs while the higher
ranked members carry heavier weapons and even warplock
pistols. The knives are long and serrated and are often rusty
or smeared in rotten corpses to ensure that the any non-lethal
wound becomes infected. The Clan members do not need to
wear armour since their bodies are hardened by the diseases
they carry they feel little pain, they rely on their thick fur to
protect them. The robes themselves offer protection equal to
soft leather and will be considered as light armour when
combined with the scattered pieces of chain mail or plate that
some plague monks do wear underneath their putrid robes.

#### Clan Skryre

This warband was based from the Skaven Warbands by Michael Hulsander and the Skryre Warband by Chris Haak
After the Eshin Clan had their coffers bolstered by the
warpstone collected from Mordheim clan Skryre became
suspicious. Ikit Klaw sent out his spies and found that
Mordheim offered a source of warpstone far easier to acquire
than mining. It would also be a great testing ground for their
new weapons of destruction.
The warped genius of the Skaven engineers is concentrated in
the work of Clan Skryre. They are the most technologically
advanced, using warpstone technology to create formidable
combat teams able to survive the City of Evil, and return with
hoards of warpstone for their warlock engineers.
Jezzail rifles, poisoned wind globes, and Warpfire throwers
are all the creations of Clan Skryre, the engineers. These
skaven are more intelligent than most, and design the war
machines used by skaven in massed warfare. When turned
upon the streets of Mordheim, the effects of these weapons
can be devastating.
Clan Skryre Warbands have great technological knowledge
and prefer Magic and Technology to combat.

machinery. The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is the pinnacle of their
devilish engineering, utilizing the corpse of a Rat Ogre combined
with a mechanical exoskeleton and powered by refined wyrdstone.
Clan Skryre has sent out the handful that it has made to further test
them in combat. In battle it is a terrifying if somewhat unreliable
beast.

Weapons/Armour: Jaws, claws, and a miniature Warpfire
thrower on its mechanical left arm.
Special Rules
Bio Machinery: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is not alive as
such, being a monstrous combination of dead flesh, arcane
Skaven technology and dark sorcery. The Clan Skryre Rat
Ogre is immune to psychology and never leaves combat.
Experience: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogres never gains
experiences.
Fear: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a fearsome, monstrous
beast that causes fear.
Immune to Poison: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is not affected
by any poisons.
Large: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a huge creature that
towers above the heads of its fellow Skaven and men alike.
Any warrior may shoot at a Rat Ogre, even if it is not the
closet target.
May Not Run: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a huge
lumbering monster-machine that lacks the sheer animal speed
of a living Rat Ogre. It may not run but may charge.
Metallic Body: These give Clan Skryre Rat Ogre a 4+
armour save.
Unreliable: The technology of biomechanics is still pretty
much in its infancy and as with most Clan Skryre
experiments is neither safe nor entirely reliable! At the
beginning of each turn, the Skaven player should roll a D6 to

```
activate and work the Rat Ogre. On a roll of 2-6 everything is
fine and the Rat Ogre may be moved normally. On the roll of
a 1, something has gone drastically wrong — roll again on
the Malfunction table.
Upkeep: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogres is always in need of
repair after battle and so the Clan Skryre Rat Ogres has an
upkeep of 35 GC, or the Clan Skryre Rat Ogres stops
working.
Malfunction table
D6 Result
1 Explodes: Something has gone horribly wrong with
the Rat Ogre's warpstone generator and it has
overloaded, exploding in a bright green flash! All
models within 6” of the Rat Ogre receive a single
Strength 5 hit. The Rat Ogre is completely destroyed.
Do not roll for injuries after the game.
2 Goes Berserk! From now until the end of the game,
the Rat Ogre is out of control. At the start of each of
the Skaven player's turns, the Rat Ogre will move
randomly (use the Artillery Scatter dice from
Warhammer to determine the distance and direction
moved) — if there are any warriors within charge
range (of either side) it will charge them, otherwise it
will move full pace towards the nearest warrior.
3 Shuts Down: The warpstone generator fizzles out and
the Rat Ogre comes to a halt for the rest of the battle.
It is hit automatically if engaged in close combat.
4 Temporary Loss of Control: The Rat Ogre moves in
a random direction and if it comes into contact with
any warriors (of either side) it attacks and counts as
charging. If it does not move into contact with any
warriors but there are warriors within range of its
Warpfire thrower, it will fire this at them instead.
5-6 Freezes: The Rat Ogre just freezes on the spot for this
turn. It is hit automatically if engaged in close combat.

#### Orc Mob

Orcs enjoy fighting and looting more than anything else. Because of this, an Orc’s life is spent in constant battle – either
with his fellow Orcs or some other enemy. With its wealth of opponents and loot ready for the taking, Mordheim offers
the perfect opportunity for an aspiring Orc Warboss to prove himself. What follows are complete rules, written by
Mark Havener, for Orc & Goblin warbands.
Among the races of the Warhammer world, none enjoy the
prospect of a good looting more than Orcs and Goblins. For
this reason many Orc warbands have been drawn to the city
of Mordheim and the wyrdstone that lies hidden there. Of
course, Orcs would much rather ambush other warbands and
take their wyrdstone than collect it themselves, but their goals
are the same as any other warband – collect as much treasure
as possible! These traits are reflected in the following special
rules:

##### Special Rules

Animosity. Orcs and Goblins enjoy nothing more than a
good scrap, unfortunately they’re not always very discerning
about who they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of
the Orc player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is
either an Orc or a Goblin. A roll of 1 means that the warrior
has taken offense to something one of his mates has done or
said. Do not roll for models that are engaged in hand-to-hand
combat (they’re already scrappin’!). To find out just how
offended the model is, roll another D6 and consult the
following chart to see what happens:
D6 Result:
1 “I ’Erd Dat!” The warrior decides that the nearest friendly
Orc or Goblin Henchman has insulted his lineage or personal
hygiene and must pay the price! If there is a friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword within charge reach (if
there are multiple targets within reach, choose the one nearest
to the mad model), the offended warrior will immediately
charge and fight a round of hand-to-hand combat against the
source of his ire. At the end of this round of combat, the
models will immediately move 1" apart and no longer count
as being in close combat (unless one of them fails another
Animosity test and rolls this result again). If there are no
friendly Orc or Goblin Henchmen or Hired Swords within
charge reach, and the warrior is armed with a missile weapon,
he immediately takes a shot at the nearest friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword. If none of the above
applies, or if the nearest friendly model is an Orc Hero, the
warrior behaves as if a 2-5 had been rolled on this chart. In
any case, the warrior in question may take no other action
this turn, though he may defend himself if attacked in hand-
to-hand combat.

```
2-5 “Wud Yoo Say?” The warrior is fairly certain he heard
an offensive sound from the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin,
but he’s not quite sure. He spends the turn hurling insults at
his mate. He may do nothing else this turn, though he may
defend himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat.
```
6. “I’ll Show Yer!” The warrior imagines that his mates are
laughing about him behind his back and calling him silly
names. To show them up he decides that he’ll be the first one
to the scrap! This model must move as quickly as possible
towards the nearest enemy model, charging into combat if
possible. If there are no enemy models within sight, the Orc
or Goblin warrior may make a normal move immediately.
This move is in addition to his regular move in the
Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a single
turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Orc or Goblin
warrior within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior
must charge into close combat during his regular movement.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.

##### Choice of Warriors

```
An Orc warband must include a minimum of three models.
You have 500 gold crowns which you can use to recruit and
equip your warband. The maximum number of warriors in
the warband is 20.
Boss: Each Orc warband must have one Boss: no more, no
less!
Shaman: Your warband may include up to one Shaman.
Big ’Uns: Your warband may include up to three Big ’Uns.
Orc Boyz: Your warband may include any number of Orc
Boyz.
Goblin Warriors: Your warband may include any number of
Goblin Warriors, though it may not have more than two
Goblins for each Orc in the warband (including Orc Heroes).
Cave Squigs: Your warband may include up to five Cave
Squigs. You may never have more Cave Squigs in your
warband than you have Goblin Warriors.
Troll: Your warband may include up to one Troll.

A Shaman starts with 10 Experience.
Big ’Uns start with 15 Experience.

An Orc Boss is a tough and brutal warrior, who will throw his lads

0-1 Orc Shaman
40 gold crowns to hire
Orc Shamans are outcasts from Orc society. They are gifted by the
Orc gods Gork and Mork with powers they can neither understand
nor completely control. Many join roaming Orc warbands where
they are no longer shunned for their abilities, but respected for
them.

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Goblin Warriors
15 gold crowns to hire
Goblins are often used as cannon fodder (as well as a food source in
lean times!) by their larger Orc cousins. They are usually not as
well equipped as Orc Boyz, having to make do with whatever the
Orcs do not want or cannot use.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

4 2 3 3 3 1 3 1 5
Weapons/Armour: Goblins may be armed with weapons
and armour chosen from Goblin equipment list.
Special Rules
Animosity: Goblin Warriors are subject to the rules for
Animosity (see Special Rules for details). Note: A Goblin
Warrior who fails his Animosity test and rolls a 1 for the
result will never charge an Orc Henchman, though he will
still use any missile weapons to attack as normal. Goblins are
far too afraid of Orcs to challenge them individually.
Not Orcs: Orcs don’t expect much from non-Orcs, and are
therefore not unsettled if Goblins or Cave Squigs break or get
cut down in battle. In fact, they expect as much from these
weaklings! Therefore, when testing to see if an Orc Warband
needs to take a Rout test, each Goblin Warrior or Cave Squig
taken out of action only counts as half a model. Therefore, a
band of 5 Orcs and 10 Goblins (15 models) would only have
to take a test if 4 models fell (4 Orcs or 8 Goblins, or some
combination thereof).
Runts: Goblins may gain experience but if they happen to
roll ‘That Lad’s got talent’ they are immediately killed by
their Orc overlords for becoming too ‘mouthy’ (remove the
Gobbo from the roster).

0-5 Cave Squigs
15 gold crowns to hire
Goblins raise the deadly Cave Squigs. These creatures are a curious
blend of animal and fungus, and are composed mostly of teeth,
horns, and a nasty temperament.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

2D6 4 0 4 3 1 4 1 5
Weapons/Armour: Big gob and brutality! Cave Squigs
never use or need weapons or armour.
Special Rules
Movement: Cave Squigs do not have a set Movement
characteristic but move with an ungainly bouncing stride. To
represent this, when moving Squigs, roll 2D6 for the distance
they move. Squigs never run and never declare charges.
Instead, they are allowed to contact enemy models with their
normal 2D6" movement. If this happens, they count as
charging for the following round of close combat, just as if
they had declared a charge.
Minderz: Each Cave Squig must always remain within 6" of
a Goblin Warrior, who keeps the creature in line. If a Cave
Squig finds itself without a Goblin within 6" at the start of its
Movement phase, it will go wild. From that point on, move
the Squig 2D6" in a random direction during each of its
Movement phases. If its movement takes it into contact with
another model (friend or foe), it will engage the model in
hand-to-hand combat as normal. The Cave Squig is out of the
Orc & Goblin player’s control until the end of the game.

```
Not Orcs: See Goblin Warriors entry for rules.
Animals: Cave Squigs are animals of a sort and so do not
gain experience.
```
```
Orc Boyz
25 gold crowns to hire
Orc Boyz are savage and tough. They fear nothing that they can get
their bare hands on, though they are even more ignorant and
superstitious than most other beings in the Warhammer world. They
form the core of any Orc warband.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
4 3 3 3 4 1 2 1 7
Weapons/Armour: Boyz may be equipped with weapons
and armour chosen from the Orc equipment list.
Special Rules
Animosity: Orc Boyz are subject to the rules for Animosity
(see Special Rules for details).
```
```
0-1 Troll
200 gold crowns to hire
Trolls are not intelligent enough to recognize the value of gold, but
large amounts of food can often instill a certain loyalty in them.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
6 3 1 5 4 3 1 3 4
Weapons/Armour: Trolls do not require weapons to fight
but often carry a big club. In any event, Trolls can never be
given weapons or armour.
Special Rules
Fear: Trolls are frightening monsters which cause fear.
Stupidity: A Troll is subject to the rules for stupidity.
Regeneration: Trolls have a unique physiology that allow
them to regenerate wounds. Whenever an enemy successfully
inflicts a wound on a Troll roll a D6, on a result of 4 or more
the wound is ignored and the Troll is unhurt. Trolls may not
regenerate wounds caused by fire or fire-based magic. Trolls
never roll for Injury after a battle.
Dumb Monster: A Troll is far too stupid to ever learn any
new skills. Trolls do not gain experience.
Always Hungry: A Troll requires an upkeep cost. This
upkeep represents the copious amounts of food that must be
fed to the Troll in order to keep him loyal to the warband.
The warband must pay 15 gold crowns after every game in
order to keep the Troll. If the warband lacks the gold to pay
the upkeep, the Boss has the option of sacrificing two Goblin
Warriors or Cave Squigs to the Troll in lieu of buying food
(Trolls eat nearly anything). If this fee is not paid (either in
gold or in warband members) the Troll gets hungry and
wanders off in search of food.
Vomit Attack: Instead of his normal attacks, a Troll can
regurgitate its highly corrosive digestive juices on an
unfortunate hand-to-hand combat opponent. This is a single
attack that automatically hits with a Strength of 5 and ignores
armour saves.

#### Black Orc Mob

From the Nemesis Crown
Smarter, stronger, more vicious and better equipped than the
normal Orc (and that’s saying something when you’re talking
about Orcs), Black Orcs are amongst some of the worst foes
anyone can face in single combat...and a band of them is
certainly something to put the fear into the hearts of men!
They do appear more built than born and it is little wonder
that there are many rumours regarding their origins.
Since the Storm of Chaos there are many, many more of
these monsters now wandering the Empire, having followed
Grimgor Ironhide in his Waaagh! Where once the forces of
the Empire could have tracked down warbands of these
creatures in a matter of weeks, now there is no means or
enough men to perform such a task and thus the Black Orcs
roam freely.
What aims do the Black Orcs have? What is the point of a
tornado? It is meaningless to ponder such matters because all
the Orcs want is to fight and that means attacking whomever
crosses their path. What they gain from such battling is not
completely understood, but it seems to be nothing more
complicated than the chance to fight. There is no logic from
them nor can any be expected.

##### Special Rules

Animosity. Orcs and Goblins enjoy nothing more than a
good scrap, unfortunately they’re not always very discerning
about who they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of
the Orc player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is

Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a single
turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Orc or Goblin
warrior within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior
must charge into close combat during his regular movement.
Let the goons do the work: Black Orcs rely on themselves
to do the killing and do not ride mounts of any kind. Only
normal Orcs may ride a boar or other such mount.
Da Boss is Dead!: If the Boss should be killed a Black Orc
will always assume leadership of the warband before any
other type, irrespective of relative experience. The
replacement will automatically acquire the "Oi Behave!"
skill.
Alignment: The Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.

##### Choice of Warriors

A Black Orc warband must include a minimum of three

The misbehaving Henchman will receive an automatic hit at
the strength of the Orc player’s choosing. If the Henchman is
still on his feet after his slap, he may add a number equal to
the strength of the slap to his subsequent roll to determine the
effects of Animosity.
e.g. The player decides that the Boss will hit a misbehaving

Orc Shootaz
25 gold crowns to hire
Not all Orcs enjoy getting into a fight straight away. Some are
hunters, tracking prey and shooting it down from a distance; others
recognise that sometimes you need to soften up a really tough foe
from a distance before moving in to finish them off. This is the
closest Orcs come to outright cowardice.

minds and they may never learn Academic Skills should they
become a Hero on an Advance Roll.

Psychology section of the Mordheim rulebook. They must
always run or charge towards the nearest opponent they can
see. If no enemy is visible they are moved under the player’s
control. They can never use any form of armour or ranged
weapons. Savage Orcs are also so primitive for other Boyz
and can never have the Leader ability or use their Ld stat for
rout tests, unless they are the only models from the warband
left on the board.

#### Forest Goblin Mob

From the Nemesis Crown
Forest Goblin tribes dwell deep within The Great Forest. They have completely adapted to their surroundings, learning stealth
and camouflage to evade their neighbours.
Gold motivates the Forest Goblins as it does any warband, albeit for different reasons. It is worthless to them as currency but
as a metallic resource, it is valuable nonetheless. Instead of using gold to buy weapons and armour, Forest Goblins actually
coat their stone equipment with the metal. This has led unscrupulous leaders to send their henchmen into certain ambush, only
to arrive later to collect the arrowheads and spear points from the remains of their former employees
Forest Goblins are able to create poisons with a precision surpassing even the Dark Elves. Their natural surroundings
harbour any number of poisonous creatures, including the gigantic spiders they are rumoured to prod into combat with their
enemies. Coating their weapons with deadly venom, the Goblins are capable of felling any foe, no matter their size. Led by
their Chieftain (usually the Goblin with the loudest voice), the Forest Goblins appear from nowhere and strike with feral
ferocity before receding into the trees, leaving injuries as the only proof they were ever there.

##### Special Rules

Natives: Used to poking through the underbrush, Forest
Goblins suffer no movement penalties from moving through
any wooded terrain.
Animosity: Goblins enjoy nothing more than a good scrap,
unfortunately they’re not always very discerning about who
they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of the Goblin
player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is either an
Orc or Goblin. A roll of 1 means that the warrior has taken
offense to something one of his mates has done or said. Do
not roll for models that are engaged in hand-to-hand combat
(they’re already scrappin’!). To find out just how offended
the model is, roll another D6 and consult the following chart
to see what happens:
D6 Result
1 “I ’Erd Dat!” The warrior decides that the nearest friendly
Goblin Henchman has insulted his lineage or personal
hygiene and must pay the price! If there is a friendly Orc
or Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword within charge reach
(if there are multiple targets within reach, choose the one
nearest to the mad model), the offended warrior will
immediately charge and fight a round of hand-to-hand
combat against the source of his ire. At the end of this
round of combat, the models will immediately move 1"
apart and no longer count as being in close combat
(unless one of them fails another Animosity test and rolls
this result again). If there are no friendly Orc or Goblin
Henchmen or Hired Swords within charge reach, and the
warrior is armed with a missile weapon, he immediately
takes a shot at the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin
Henchman or Hired Sword. If none of the above applies,
or if the nearest friendly model is an Goblin Hero, the
warrior behaves as if a 2-5 had been rolled on this chart.
In any case, the warrior in question may take no other
action this turn, though he may defend himself if attacked
in hand-to-hand combat.
2-5 “Wud Yoo Say?” The warrior is fairly certain he heard
an offensive sound from the nearest friendly Goblin, but
he’s not quite sure. He spends the turn hurling insults at
his mate. He may do nothing else this turn, though he may
defend himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat.

6. “I’ll Show Yer!” The warrior imagines that his mates are
    laughing about him behind his back and calling him silly

```
names. To show them up he decides that he’ll be the first
one to the scrap! This model must move as quickly as
possible towards the nearest enemy model, charging into
combat if possible. If there are no enemy models within
sight, the Goblin may make a normal move immediately.
This move is in addition to his regular move in the
Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a
single turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Goblin
within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior must
charge into close combat during his regular movement.
Giant Spider Mount: If you are using the optional rules for
mounts, then your warband’s heroes may ride giant spiders.
The rider’s armor save increased by +1, exactly as if mounted
on an ordinary horse. The rider need not dismount to climb
terrain (including building exteriors) and the spider’s natural
climbing abilities allow the rider to re-roll any failed
climbing attempts. The Giant Spider count as Rare 5 and
Cost 45Gold Crown for Forest Goblins Mobs.
Alignment: The Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.
```
##### Choice of Warriors

```
A Forest Goblin warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 gold crowns which you can use to
recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband may never exceed 20.
Chieftain: Each Forest Goblin warband must have one
Chieftain.
Braves: Your warband may include up to four Braves.
Shaman: Your warband may include one Shaman, but he can
only be taken instead of a Brave.
Forest Goblins: Any number of models may be Forest
Goblins.
Red Toof Boyz: Your warband may include up to five Red
Toof Boyz.
Sluggas: Your warband may include up to five Sluggas.
Gigantic Spider: Your warband may include one Gigantic
Spider.

#### Hobgoblins Wolf Rider Mob

Based on Hobgoblin Raiders by the unnamed author and Hob Goblins Warband by Brian Coggin & James S. Mackay.
The acrid smell of wolf musk precedes them as they drift silently through the ruins. You know they’re somewhere, but still you
don’t see them. The sharp twangs of their bowstrings echoing through the city send you diving for cover, but it isn’t until the
deadly barbed arrows strike that you see your opponents. As you muster the warband, your cunning opposition is already
moving back into the shadows to circle for another guerrilla strike. The treacherous hobgoblins have arrived!

##### Background

Khans and their hobgoblin wolf riders have always plunged
deep into any territory where their swift swords and sure
arrows could bring them wealth, and Hogada Khan and his
Keregit raiders are no different. When human captives
revealed to Hogada the rumors of the untold riches available
in Mordheim, the opportunistic leader immediately
abandoned his orders from the Ka-Khan and steered his wolf
riders towards the City of the Dammed.
The Keregit raiders keep their camp on a constant move, and
few have discovered the motley collection of yurts and lived
to tell the tale. Years of constant warfare has taught Hogada
Khan that mobility and secrecy are his two greatest allies.
Certainly more reliable than most of his treacherous warriors.
Only a swift sword delivering death to those who oppose his
rule has kept this group together. Although the wealth the
hobgoblins are earning in Mordheim helps with loyalty, as it
far exceeds what they’re used to finding on the warpath.
Soon after arriving Hogada began raiding the city with large
groups of wolf riders, but the clever git quickly realized two
things. First, Mordheim is not the steppe, and large parties
cannot move through the ruins with the stealth and agility a
hobgoblin must have to survive. Secondly, the Khan
discovered that wolves were not the best form of
transportation through the rubble, as his warriors were
constantly dismounting to traverse small caverns, pass
through doorways, and climb to upper levels of buildings.
Now Hogada sends his Ilkhans, or subordinate khans, into the
city with small and stealthy raiding parties to gather the
precious wyrdstone. Although some of these groups still have
wolves as steeds, the majority of the raiders have retrained
their wolves to fight without riders.
The new system works well for the hobgoblins, and they’ve
seen a great deal of success since arriving on the scene. The
stealthy hobgoblins are deadly with their bows, and the
slavering wolves provide the raiders with an excellent fast
attack squad. As long as the treacherous warriors remain
disciplined, the hobgoblins are warbands to be reckoned with.

##### Special Rules

```
Treacherous Gits: Hobgoblins are notorious for their
treachery in all things, including combat. For all henchmen
not already in hand to hand combat roll a d6 at the beginning
of each turn. If they roll a 1 on that d6 then roll another and
reference the following chart:
1 – The treacherous git switches sides, and can now be
controlled by the opposing team for the rest of the
battle. If there are multiple opponents the hobgoblin
will attach himself the warband with the highest
rating. Note that this hobgoblin must still take
treachery tests, and therefore could end up back on his
original team
2-5 – The hobgoblin is too interested in saving his own skin
that he will refuse to shoot or charge this turn, but may
perform other actions.
6 – The henchman is infused with fresh determination and
loyalty, and doesn’t need to roll further treachery tests
for the rest of the game
Giant Wolves: The warband may include a number of Giant
Wolves as detailed below. These must be ridden into battle.
You may nominate either heroes or henchmen to ride these
wolves and the rules for mounted models in the Mordheim
book apply, however the riders will not dismount for any
reason during a battle, so it is generally a bad idea to have an
entire warband mounted. If the model is taken out of action
roll for both the rider and the wolf on the serious injury table.
You may switch riders between battles if you like. While
mounted models are unable to enter buildings in above-
ground scenarios they may still be ridden in tomb raider
scenarios, however due to their bulk and the nature of the
tombs mounted models may not run while inside of tombs,
and will only charge their normal move distance (a charge
must still be declared as normal, however, and you cannot
simply 'move' into hand to hand combat.)
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.
```
##### Choice of Warriors

```
A Hobgoblin Wolf Riders must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 gold crowns which you can use to
recruit and equip your warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband is 15.

### Campaigns

Warbands travel to the City of the Damned from all over the
Old World. They come from many races and for many
reasons but ultimately they must all face the dangers of the
dim alleys and twisting, winding streets of Mordheim.
Although it is great fun to fight individual battles, part of the
challenge of Mordheim is to build your warband into a force
to be reckoned with. A campaign gives your warband the
chance to gain experience and new skills, as well as the
opportunity to hire extra warriors as its fame and fortune
increases.

#### Starting a campaign

To start a campaign you’ll need at least two players,
preferably three or more. Players may have more than one
warband, but most people prefer to run one at a time, as this
allows them to devote more of their attention to painting,
modelling and playing with their favourite warband.
You can start a campaign as soon as two players have
recruited their warbands. New players can join the campaign
any time after that. Although the new warbands will be less
experienced they will soon learn new skills. Fighting other,
more powerful, warbands will allow them to develop more
quickly.

#### Playing a campaign game

To start the campaign, the two players select one of the
scenarios to fight (see the Scenarios section). At
the end of each game the players work out how much
experience their warriors have earned and how much
wyrdstone the warband has collected before returning to its
encampment.
Experience is expressed as Experience points which Heroes
and Henchmen groups receive for surviving each game. This
is covered later in the Experience section. When a Hero or a
group of Henchmen has sufficient Experience points they
receive an advance. An advance might improve a warrior’s
characteristics profile, adding to his WS, BS, S etc, or he
might gain a special skill such as Mighty Blow or Acrobat.
After each game the warriors collect wyrdstone. This is
recorded on the warband’s roster sheet, and can later be sold
for gold, used for trading, etc. You can recruit more warriors
or buy new weapons from traders. All this is explained in the
Income and Trading sections, later.

#### Warband rating

Each warband has a warband rating – the higher the rating
the better the warband. The warband rating is simply the
number of warriors in it multiplied by 5, plus their
accumulated experience.
Large creatures such as Rat Ogres are worth 20 points plus
the number of Experience points they have accumulated.
The warband’s rating changes after each game, because
surviving warriors will gain extra experience, warriors may
have been killed, new ones added, etc. Hopefully your
warband rating will go up, signifying your increase in power!

#### Post battle sequence

After the battle is over, both players work their way through
the following sequence. You do not have to work through it
all at once (try to do the first three parts straight after the
battle – you may wish to consider further purchases later) but

```
any dice rolls must be seen by both players or a neutral third
party.
1 Injuries. Determine the extent of injuries for each warrior
who is out of action at the end of the game. See the Serious
Injuries, on page 118.
2 Allocate experience. Heroes and Henchmen groups gain
experience for surviving battles. See the Experience and
Scenarios sections for details.
3 Roll on the Exploration chart. See the Income section for
details.
4 Sell Wyrdstone. This can only be done once per post battle
sequence.
5 Check available veterans. Roll to see how much
Experience worth of veterans is available for hire. You don’t
have to commit to hiring any at this point.
6 Make rarity rolls and buy rare items. Make rolls for any
rare items you intend to buy and pay for them. These items
go into the warband’s stash.
7 Look for Dramatis Personae. If you want to hire any.
8 Hire new recruits & buy common items. New recruits
come equipped with their free dagger and may be bought
common items. This is done in any order and may be done
several times. Note that newly hired recruits cannot buy rare
items. They can, however, be equipped with rare items if
there are any in the warband’s stash in stage 9.
9 Reallocate equipment. Swap equipment between models
as desired (provided they are eligible to use it).
10 Update your warband rating. You are now ready to
fight again.
```
#### Disbanding warbands

```
You may disband your old warband at the end of any game
and start again with a new one. All the warriors in the
original warband and any equipment and other benefits they
acquired are lost. You can also dismiss any warrior in your
warband at any time.
```
#### Death of a Warrior

```
When a warrior is killed (Hero or Henchman) all his weapons
and equipment are lost. This is very important, so be clear
about it from the start. It is not possible to reallocate a
warrior’s weapons or equipment once he is dead.
```
#### Death of a Leader

```
If the leader of the warband is slain, the Hero with the next
highest Leadership value takes command. He then gains the
Leader ability (although he must continue to use his original
Skill list) and can use the Equipment list available to the
leader. If there is more than one Hero eligible to assume
command, the warrior with the most Experience points
becomes the leader. In the case of a tie roll a D6 to decide the
new leader. Note that you may not hire a new leader for your
warband.
In the case of Undead warbands, the death of the Vampire
means that the warband’s Necromancer must take over. If the
warband doesn’t include one, the spells that hold the restless
dead together unravel, and the warband collapses into a pile
of bones. You can buy a Vampire after the next game, at
which point the Necromancer will step down (whether he
wants to or not) and lose the Leader skill.

If the leader of a Sisters of Sigmar, Possessed or Carnival of
Chaos warband dies then their successor will be entitled to
learn to use magic in their stead. The new leader may roll for
a prayer / spell from the appropriate list, instead of rolling on
the Advance table, the first time they are eligible for an
advance. After this they are considered to be a Magic / Pray
User as appropriate for their warband and use the Advance
table as normal.

#### Buying new equipment between games

As explained in the Trading section, warriors may purchase
new equipment and armaments using the warband’s treasury.
Warriors can also swap equipment between themselves.
Alternatively, old equipment can be hoarded and re-used at a
later date.
Weapons and armour purchased, swapped or taken from
storage for your warband must be of an appropriate type for
the warrior, as indicated by the warband lists. Record any
changes to the warrior’s equipment on the roster sheet.

#### Serious injuries

During a game some warriors will be taken out of action and
removed from play. At that time it doesn’t matter whether the
warrior is dead, unconscious, injured or just playing dead – in
game terms he is no longer capable of fighting in the battle
which is all that matters.
When you are playing a campaign it matters a great deal what
happens to warriors who are taken out of action! They might
recover completely and be ready to fight in the next battle, or
they might have sustained injuries. Worst of all they might
die, or be so badly injured that they have to retire.
When a Henchman receives a serious injury this is treated
differently than if a Hero received one (this is to represent the
greater effect that losing a Hero would have on your
warband). Working out the extent of a Henchman’s injuries is
very simple. You will need to roll on the chart opposite to
determine what has happened to your Hero. The chart covers
a whole range of injuries and random things that might befall
your warrior. Bear in mind that only Heroes who are taken
out of action are obliged to roll on this chart.

##### Henchman with Serious Injuries

```
Henchmen who are out of action at the end of the battle are
removed permanently from the roster sheet on a D6 roll of 1-
```
2. They have either suffered severe injuries, died of their
wounds, or decided to quit the warband. On a roll of 3-6 they
can fight in the next battle as normal.

##### Heroes with Serious Injuries

```
After a battle some of your Heroes may be taken out of
action. You will need to determine the extent of their injuries
before the next game.
To use the Heroes’ Serious Injuries chart opposite, roll two
D6. The first dice roll represents ‘tens’ and the second
‘units’, so that a roll of 1 and 5 is 15, a roll of 3 and 6 is 36,
etc. This type of dice roll is referred to as a ‘D66 roll’.
```

#### Heroes’ serious injuries chart (roll D66)

11-15 DEAD
The warrior is dead and his body is abandoned in the dark
alleys of Mordheim, never to be found again. All the
weapons and equipment he carried are lost. Remove him
from the warband’s roster.
16-21 MULTIPLE INJURIES
The warrior is not dead but has suffered a lot of wounds. Roll
D6 times on this table. Re-roll any ‘Dead’, ‘Captured’ and
further ‘Multiple Injuries’ results.
22 LEG WOUND
The warrior’s leg is broken. He suffers a -1 Movement
characteristic penalty from now on.
23 ARM WOUND
Roll again: 1 = Severe arm wound. The arm must be
amputated. The warrior may only use a single one handed
weapon from now on. 2-6 = Light wound. The warrior must
miss the next game.

25 SMASHED LEG
Roll again: 1 = The warrior may not run any more but he may
still charge. 2-6 = The warrior misses the next game.
26 CHEST WOUND
The warrior has been badly wounded in the chest. He
recovers but is weakened by the injury so his Toughness is
reduced by -1.
31 BLINDED IN ONE EYE
The warrior survives but loses the sight in one eye; randomly
determine which. A character that loses an eye has his
Ballistic Skill reduced by -1. If the warrior is subsequently
blinded in his remaining good eye he must retire from the
warband.
32 OLD BATTLE WOUND
The warrior survives, but his wound will prevent him from
fighting if you roll a 1 on a D6 at the start of any battle. Roll
at the start of each battle from now on.
33 NERVOUS CONDITION
The warrior’s nervous system has been damaged. His
Initiative is permanently reduced by -1.
34 HAND INJURY
The warrior’s hand is badly injured. His Weapon Skill is
permanently reduced by -1.
35 DEEP WOUND
The warrior has suffered a serious wound and must miss the
next D3 games while he is recovering. He may do nothing at

and equipment are lost.

```
41-55 FULL RECOVERY
The warrior has been knocked unconscious, or suffers a light
wound from which he makes a full recovery.
56 BITTER ENMITY
The warrior makes a full physical recovery, but is
psychologically scarred by his experience. From now on the
warrior hates the following (roll a D6):
D6 Result
1-3 The individual who caused the injury. If it was a Henchman,
he hates the enemy leader instead.
4 The leader of the warband that caused the injury.
5 The entire warband of the warrior responsible for the injury.
6 All warbands of that type.
61 CAPTURED
The warrior regains consciousness and finds himself held
captive by the other warband.
He may be ransomed at a price set by the captor or
exchanged for one of their warband who is being held
captive.
Captives may be sold to slavers at a price of D6x5 GC.
Undead may kill their captive and gain a new Zombie.
The Possessed may sacrifice the prisoner. The leader of the
warband will gain +1 Experience if they do so.
Captives who are exchanged or ransomed retain all their
weapons, armour and equipment; if captives are sold, killed
or turned to Zombies, their weaponry, etc, is retained by their
captors.
62-63 HARDENED
The warrior survives and becomes inured to the horrors of
Mordheim. From now on he is immune to fear.
64 HORRIBLE SCARS
The warrior causes fear from now on.
65 SOLD TO THE PITS
The warrior wakes up in the infamous fighting pits of
Cutthroat’s Haven and must fight against a Pit Fighter. See
the Hired Swords section for full rules for Pit Fighters.
Roll to see which side charges, and fight the battle as normal.
If the warrior loses, roll to see whether he is dead or injured
(i.e., a D66 roll of 11-35). If he is not dead, he is thrown out
of the fighting pits without his armour and weapons and may
re-join his warband.
If the warrior wins he gains 50 GC, +2 Experience and is free
to rejoin his warband with all his weapons and equipment.
66 SURVIVES AGAINST THE ODDS
The warrior survives and rejoins his warband. He gains +1
Experience.

### Experience

As warriors take part in battles, those who survive become
more experienced, and improve their battle skills. This is
represented in campaigns by Experience points.
Warriors earn Experience points when they take part in a
battle. Once a warrior has enough points he gains an advance.
This takes the form of an increased characteristic or a new
skill. Warriors who survive long enough may progress to
become great Heroes, with many skills that they have picked
up during their long and glorious fighting career.
When warriors are recruited, some of them already have
some experience. The warband lists detail how many
Experience points different warriors begin with. Record these
on your warband roster sheet by ticking the right number of
boxes. No extra advances are gained for this experience. It
simply represents the experience the warriors have
accumulated before the warband is formed.

#### Earning experience

The Experience points warriors earn depend on the scenario.
Different scenarios have different objectives and
consequently warriors can earn experience in slightly
different ways.
Extra Experience points are always added to the fighter’s
total after the game is over, though it is a good idea to keep a
record of the opponents your warrior puts out of action
during the battle, as this often affects the experience they
gain.
If you look through the scenarios you will notice that
warriors always earn +1 Experience point for surviving a
battle. They earn this even if they are injured – so long as
they live to fight again!
The Scenarios section includes details of how many
Experience points are earned for each scenario.

#### Experience advances

As warriors earn more Experience points they are entitled to
make Advance rolls. The warband roster sheet shows how
much experience a Hero or a Henchman group must
accumulate before making a further roll. When the
accumulated experience reaches a box that has thick borders,
the warrior may make an Advance roll. The roll(s) must be
taken immediately after the game in which the advance was
earned, while both players are present to witness the result.
Note that Henchmen gain experience as a group, and
consequently all the warriors in one group gain the same
advance.

#### Underdogs

When a warband fights against an enemy warband with a
higher rating, its warriors earn extra Experience points as
shown on the table below. The higher the opposing
warband’s rating the more points the underdog earns.
Difference in Warband rating Experience Bonus
0 - 50 None
51 - 75 +1
76 - 100 +2
101 - 150 +3
151 - 300 +4
301+ +5

#### Advance rolls

```
Make Advance rolls straight after the battle so both players
can witness the result. Roll 2D6 and consult the appropriate
tables below.
```
##### Heroes

```
2D6 Result
2 - 5 New Skill. Select one of the Skill tables available to the
Hero and pick a skill. If he is a wizard he may choose to
randomly generate a new spell instead of a skill. See the
Magic section.
6 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Strength; 4-6
= +1 Attack.
7 Characteristic Increase. Choose either +1 WS or +1 BS.
8 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Initiative; 4-6
= +1 Leadership.
9 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Wound; 4-6
= +1 Toughness.
10 - 12 New Skill. Select one of the Skill tables available to the
Hero and pick a skill. If he is a wizard he may choose to
randomly generate a new spell instead of a skill.
```
##### Henchmen

```
Henchmen never add more than +1 point to any of their
initial characteristics. If the dice roll indicates an increase in a
characteristic which has already been increased (or is at its
racial maximum), roll again until an unincreased
characteristic is rolled. All warriors in the group gain the
same advance.
2D6 Result
2 - 4 Advance +1 Initiative.
5 Advance +1 Strength.
6 - 7 Advance Choose either +1 BS or +1WS.
8 Advance +1 Attack.
9 Advance +1 Leadership.
10 - 12 The lad’s got talent. One model in the group becomes a
Hero. If you already have the maximum number of
Heroes, roll again. The new Hero remains the same
Henchman type (e.g., a Ghoul stays as a Ghoul) and starts
with the same experience the Henchman had, with all his
characteristic increases intact. You may choose two skill
lists available to Heroes in your warband. These are the
skill types your new Hero can choose from when he gains
new skills. He can immediately make one roll on the
Heroes Advance table. The remaining members of the
Henchmen group, if any, roll again for the advance that
they have earned, re-rolling any results of 10-12.
```
#### New skills

```
There are several types of skill and each has a separate list.
You may not choose the same skill twice for the same
warrior. The skills a Hero may have are restricted by the
warband he belongs to and what type of Hero he is.
To select a new skill for a Hero, pick the type of skill you
want from those available, then choose which skill has been
learned.
```

#### Characteristic increase

Characteristics for certain warriors may not be increased
beyond the maximum limits shown on the following profiles.
If a characteristic is at its maximum, take the other option or
roll again if you can only increase one characteristic. If both
are already at their racial maximum, you may increase any
other (that is not already at its racial maximum) by +1
instead. Note that this is the only way to gain the maximum
Movement for some races. Remember that Henchmen can
only add +1 to any characteristic.

### Skills & Abilities Lists

The Skill lists are used to pick skills earned as advances. Your warrior is restricted to specific Skill lists depending upon his
warband type and what kind of warrior he is. Each warband entry includes a list of skills available to the Heroes of that
particular warband.
All warbands have their own strengths and weaknesses which relate to the skills available to them. For example, the Possessed
are good fighters and very strong, but they are not very academically minded.
Some warbands also have access to a unique Skill list, which is clearly indicated in their entry.

#### Common Skills

The common skills are available to any Hero, Henchmen & Hired Sword who wishers for these Skills.
Animal\Beast Handler (e.g. War hound): This skill is highly
beneficial if non-ridden animals are to be included in a warband.
This skill must be taken for specific animals and may be taken
multiple times for different animals. It represents knowledge of the
general care and well being of the animal as well as training
techniques.

A warrior with this skill has a beneficial effect on the animals under
his care. If a warrior has the Animal Handling skill for a particular
animal, any such animals may use his Leadership provided he is
within 6". If the Warband’s leader is also nearby, a player may
choose which of the warriors’ Leadership to use unless the animal is
stupid, in which case only the handler’s Leadership may be used. In
addition, stubborn animals with a handler in base contact ignore the
effects of stubbornness.

Beast Companion: A Hero or Warrior with this skill may buy an
attack animal, the attack animal must be set up with the owning
model within 3". But free to move around once started. The attack
animal may use the owner Leadership if within 6". The attack
animal does not count towards the maximum number of warriors
allowed in your warband. If the owner is stunned or knocked down,
the attack animal will move to it owner and guard him\her until the
Owner get up or the games ends. If the owner dies the attack animal
is lost.

Dirty Fighter: Warriors with this skill can choose skills from the
Dirty Tricks Skills list.

Far-sight: The warrior has become gifted with extra sensory
powers. Some are able to look into the future, others more widely in
the now. Some see multiple possible paths which can be
manipulated, others only one inalterable path. For time outside of
memory leaders have valued the ability to know more than their
enemies.

Warrior with this skill can choose skills from the Special Far-sight
Ability. Only one model per warband may have this skill, this skill
cannot be taken by Sisters of Sigmar, Dwarves, and Witch Hunters
warbands or hired swords unless noted. Each far-sight ability is
treated exactly like magical spells in every respect.

Mark of Chaos (Heroes only): Not all who goes to Mordheim goes
with good intensions, some see what happen as a sign that the
Greater Chaos Powers are on the move, so they went to meet them.

Heroes from a Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic warbands (other than
Skaven and undead) may bare one Mark of Chaos. Each mark
increases the warband’s rating by +10 points. If the leader has any
other mark then Undivided all heroes must have the same mark. The
hero may choose from the Marks of Chaos list.

```
Medical Knowledge: If you have a warrior in your warband with
this skill you may re-roll a result on the Serious Injury table. If the
model with this skill is not taken out of action.
Musician: Musicians are important to a warband both during and
after a battle. They can sing and tell tales to raise extra income, sing
songs of valour during battle to embolden the troops, and rally the
troops when things look bad.
Warrior with this skill can choose skills from the Musicians Skills
list. Only one model per warband may have this skill, this skill
cannot be taken by the leader or hired swords unless noted.
Mob Mentality (Heroes only): If a model with this skill is within 3”
of at least three other models from his warband, then he gives all of
the models in that area, including himself, immunity to fear and +1
Initiative. If the model, with Mob Mentality, is taken out of action
while giving bonuses, then all models who are benefiting from the
effects will automatically fail an “All alone check” and move
accordingly.
Money Maker (Heroes only): The model with this skill utilizes his
talents and wares to try and make extra money after the adventure. If
the model is not taken out of action, they may roll an additional die
during the exploration phase and choose which one they want.
Ride (e.g. Ride Horse): This skill is vital if a rider wishes to ride an
animal into combat. The skill is specific to a particular type of
animal and must be gained again if the warrior wishes to be able to
ride a different kind of animal. For instance, a warrior with Ride
Horse would need to gain the skill Ride Warhorse if he wanted to be
able to ride such a spirited mount. Warriors with this skill can
choose skills from the Cavalry Skills list
Sewer Fighter: Warriors with this skill can choose skills from the
Sewer Fighter Skills list. This skill cannot be given to ogres.
Sneaky: All enemy models halve their Initiative range when trying
to detect this model while he is Hidden.
```

#### Combat Skills

Strike to Injure: The warrior can land his blows with uncanny
accuracy. Add +1 to all injury rolls caused by the model in hand-to-
hand combat.

Combat Master: The warrior is able to take on several opponents at
once. If he fights against more than one enemy at a time, he gains an
extra Attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase as long as he is
fighting two or more enemy models. In addition, the warrior is
immune to ‘All Alone’ tests.

Weapons Training: A warrior with this skill is adept at using many
different weapons. He may use any hand-to-hand combat weapon he
comes across, not just those in his equipment options.

Web of Steel: Few can match the ability of this warrior. He fights
with great skill, weaving a web of steel around him. The model
gains +1 to all his rolls on Critical Hit tables in hand-to-hand
combat.

Expert Swordsman: This warrior has been expertly taught in the
art of swordsmanship. He may re-roll all missed attacks if he is
using a sword in the hand-to-hand phase of the turn that he charges.
Note that this only applies when they are armed with normal swords
or weeping blades, and not with double-handed swords or any other
weapons.

Step Aside: The warrior has a natural ability to avoid injury in
combat. Each time he suffers a wound in close combat he may make
an additional saving throw of 5+. This save is never modified and is
taken after all other armour saves.

Axe Master: The warrior may parry with normal axes as per normal
parrying rules.

Disarm: The warrior may opt to forego his normal attacks and
attempt to disarm a single opponent. To disarm the opponent, the
warrior must declare what weapon he is disarming and then roll to
hit the foe at a -2 WS for a single handed weapon and a -3 WS for a
2 handed weapon. If successful the opponent must fight without the
designated weapon until he recovers it. The foe recovers his weapon
in the first Recovery Phase out of Hand-to-Hand. Not vs. natural
weaponry.

Expert Axeman: Re-roll all failed hits with an Axe when being
charging.

```
Finishing Move: The warrior may opt to forgo his usual number of
attacks and make a single attack at an additional +2 Strength to its
normal strength. This can be used in conjunction with Mighty Blow,
Weapon Bonuses, and any other Strength enhancing abilities. The
blow is resolved last AFTER 2 Handed Weapons. Useful for taking
out Knocked Down models with high Toughness.
Follow Thru: In any Hand-to-Hand combat where all of the
warrior’s foes are knocked down, stunned, or taken out of action the
warrior may opt to make a follow thru move of up to 2 inches in any
direction. This move can bring him into base contact with another
model, and he will fight in the next Hand-to-Hand phase, but neither
model counts as charging. This move is executed at the very end of
the Hand-to-Hand phase after everyone has finished striking. If
multiple models have this skill, then they move in Initiative order.
Simultaneous movers from opposing forces within range
automatically move to intercept one another.
Pugilist: The warrior may fight barehanded with no penalty one or
two handed. The model always gets an extra attack for having 2
weapons when fighting barehanded or with one weapon and no
shield or buckler. Fight barehanded w/o penalty, +1 Attack
Shield Smash: The warrior has trained to integrate his shield into
his fighting style. When using a Shield or Buckler in Hand-to-Hand
he may make a single additional attack resolved at the warriors
Strength. The Shield Smash cannot cause critical hits. +1 Attack
Sweeping Blow: The warrior may opt to make a single sweep attack
against all the models in base to base contact with him instead of
making his normal attacks. Rather than rolling to hit, each foe rolls
under their Initiative to avoid the blow. Each model failing their
Initiative roll is hit, and the warrior rolls to wound each enemy
independently as normal. This maneuver can only be executed with
a two-handed weapon (including halberds and flails, etc.), but no
Strength bonuses granted by the weapons themselves are included.
Whip Master: The hero is so skilled with his whip that he may re-
roll all to-hit rolls when using the whip. Only one re-roll is allowed
per attempt and you must accept the second roll, even if it is worse.
[Based on the Adventurer’s Whip Rules by Jo-Herman Haugholt
from the Mordheim Khemri Discussion Group.]
```
#### Shooting Skills

Quick Shot: The warrior may shoot twice per turn with a bow or
crossbow (but not a crossbow pistol).

Pistolier: The warrior is an expert at using all kinds of pistols. If he
is equipped with a brace of pistols of any type (including crossbow
pistols), he may fire twice in the Shooting phase (though note that
normal reloading rules apply). If he has a single pistol then he may
fire it in the same turn it was reloaded.

Eagle Eyes: The warrior’s sight is exceptionally keen. He adds +6"
to the range of any missile weapon he is using.

Weapons Expert: The warrior has been trained to use some of the
more unusual weapons of the known world. He may use any missile
weapon he comes across, not just the weapons available from his
warband’s list.

Nimble: The warrior may move and fire with weapons that are
normally only used if the firer has not moved. Note that this skill
cannot be combined with the Quick Shot skill.

```
Trick Shooter: The warrior can shoot through the tiniest gap
without it affecting his aim. He ignores all modifiers for cover when
using missile weapons.
Hunter: The warrior is an expert at getting his weapon loaded and
ready. He may fire each turn with a handgun or Hochland long rifle.
Knife-Fighter: The warrior is an unrivalled expert at using
throwing knives and throwing stars. He can throw a maximum of
three of these missiles in his shooting phase and may divide his
shots between any targets within range as he wishes. Note that this
skill cannot be combined with the Quick Shot skill.
Vitals Shot: The warrior is adept at shooting where it hurts the
most. He adds +1 to rolls on the Critical Wound effect chart when
using ranged attacks.
Fletcher: The warrior makes his own arrows. When shooting a bow,
his arrows are +1 to rolls on the Injury Chart.
Heavy Pull: The warrior has trained to use a bow with a heavier
draw. All attacks made by the warrior with a bow are at +1 Strength.

#### Academic Skills

Battle Tongue: This skill may only be chosen by a leader. The
warrior has drilled his warband to follow short barked commands.
This increases the range of his Leader ability by 6". Note that
Undead leaders may not use this skill.

Sorcery: This skill may only be taken by Heroes that is a Magic
User. A warrior with this skill gains +1 to his rolls to see whether he
can cast spells successfully or not. Note that Pray Users may not use
this skill.

Streetwise: A warrior with this skill has good contacts and knows
where to purchase rare items. He may add +2 to the roll that
determines his chances of finding such items (see the Trading
section).

Haggle: The warrior knows all the tricks of bargaining and
haggling. He may deduct 2D6 gold crowns from the price of any
single item (to a minimum cost of 1gc) once per post battle
sequence.

Arcane Lore: Witch Hunters, Sisters of Sigmar and Warrior-Priests
may not have this skill. Any warrior with this skill may learn Lesser
Magic if he owns a Tome of Magic.

Wyrdstone Hunter: The warrior has an uncanny ability to find
hidden shards of wyrdstone. If a Hero with this skill is searching the
ruins in the exploration phase you may re-roll one dice when rolling
on the Exploration chart. The second result stands.

Warrior Wizard: This skill may only be taken by Magic / Pray
Users. The mental powers of the wizard allow him to wear armour
and cast spells.

Scribe: The warrior is a natural adept at writing and making scrolls.
Any warrior with the ability to cast spells or use prayers may take
this skill. It allows them to make a scroll before the battle and
inscribe a single spell or prayer upon it that they are versed in. The
scroll may be used just before they are about to cast the spell or
prayer and allows the caster +2 to his difficulty roll. Once used the
scroll will crumble to dust and is useless. Scrolls may not be saved
up from battle to battle if they are not used.

Mind Focus: The warrior possesses a great strength of mind which
allows him to concentrate beyond the levels of most normal men.
This skill may only be taken by a be taken by Magic / Pray Users.
When using a spell or prayer the warrior with this skill may reroll
one dice roll used in the difficulty roll.

```
Tactician: This skill may only be taken by a warband leader. The
warrior has a great tactical mind and can often find the best
positions for his warriors to meet the oncoming attack. In any
scenario the warband leader may reposition his warriors after his
opponent has set up and may even advance them up to 12 inch onto
the board instead of 8 inch.
Hunch: This skill may only be taken by the warband leader. The
warrior has an uncanny knack of placing his men in the right place
at the right time, as if he senses danger through instinct alone. In any
scenario the warband leader may position up to 3 of his men capable
of earning experience in any ruined building on the board that is at
least 12 inch away from an enemy model and not in the enemy
deployment zone.
Magical Aptitude: This skill may only be taken by a Magic User. It
may not be used by pray-users. The warrior has a keep aptitude for
magic and can push himself beyond normal limits to produce a
storm of spells. The warrior may attempt to cast two spells each turn
as long as he is not in hand-to-hand combat. After attempting the
first spell, he must take a toughness test. If he passes he may attempt
a second spell that turn or even cast the same spell twice. If he fails
he must roll on the injury table immediately with no saves treating
Out Of Action results as Stunned instead.
Trap Expert: This Hero is able to detect traps in the tombs with
relative ease. A character who possesses this skill will never set off
traps himself (but may be subject to their effects if he is too close to
one if it goes off). He can attempt to disarm any traps he comes
across. He must stop at the trap during his Movement phase, and
may do nothing else that turn. To disarm a Simple trap, he must roll
6+ on 2D6. To disarm a Complex trap, he must roll 8+ on 2D6. If
unsuccessful, he must test against his Initiative. A failed test means
he has inadvertently set off the trap himself!
He is also able to restore dud traps or previously de-activated traps
back into active traps. To determine what a Dud trap becomes, roll
a D6: 1-4: Simple, 5-6: Complex. Obviously a previously disarmed
trap will revert back to what it was. If restoring a Simple trap, he
must roll a 6+ on 2D6. If restoring a Complex trap, he must roll an
8+. Failure will mean that the trap has failed to activate.
Drive Chariot: Chariots are very difficult to control and a warrior
must have this skill to drive a chariot effectively in combat. A
charioteer without this skill cannot charge.
```
#### Strength Skills

Mighty Blow: The warrior knows how to use his strength to
maximum effect and has a +1 Strength bonus in close combat
(excluding pistols). As his Strength is used for close combat
weapons, the bonus applies to all such weapons.
Pit Fighter: The warrior has learned how to fight in enclosed spaces
from his time in the dangerous fighting pits of the Empire. He is an
expert at fighting in confined areas and adds +1 to his WS and +1 to
his Attacks if he is fighting inside buildings or ruins. It’s a good idea
to define which bits of your terrain collection count as ‘buildings or
ruins’ at the start of a battle to avoid confusion later.
Resilient: The warrior is covered in battle scars. Deduct -1 Strength
from all hits against him in close combat. This does not affect
armour save modifiers.
Fearsome: Such is the reputation and physique of the model that he
causes fear in opposing models.

```
Strongman: The warrior is capable of great feats of strength. He
may use a double-handed weapon without the usual penalty of
always striking last. Work out order of battle as you would with
other weapons.
Unstoppable Charge: When he charges, the warrior is almost
impossible to halt. He adds +1 to his Weapon Skill when charging.
Bell Ringer: 1 Attack Only, +1 to hit, +1 S, no Weapon Bonuses,
foe Stunned on a 2-5 on Injury Chart.
Untiring: When wielding Flails and Morning Stars, the Hero may
use the Strength Bonuses every Hand-to-Hand phase of the game,
not just the first round of a Hand-to-Hand engagement. (Created by
Jester.)
Strong Legs: The Hero may use Heavy Armour and a Shield
without suffering Movement penalties.

#### Speed Skills

Leap: The warrior may leap D6" in the movement phase in addition
to his normal movement. He may move and leap, run and leap, or
charge and leap, but he can only leap once per turn.
A leaping warrior may jump over opposing man-sized models,
including enemies, and obstacles 1" high, without penalty.
The leap may also be used to leap over gaps, but in this case you
must commit the warrior to making the leap before rolling the dice
to see how far he jumps. If he fails to make it all the way across, he
falls through the gap (see page 6).
Sprint: The warrior may triple his Movement rate when he runs or
charges, rather than doubling it as normal.
Acrobat: The warrior is incredibly supple and agile. He may fall or
jump from a height of up to 12" without taking any damage if he
passes a single Initiative test, and can re-roll failed Diving Charge
rolls. He can still only make a diving charge from a height of up to
6".
Lightning Reflexes: If the warrior is charged he will ‘strike first’
against those that charged that turn. As the charger(s) will also
normally ‘strike first’ (for charging), the order of attack between the
charger(s) and the warrior with this skill will be determined by
comparing Initiative values.
Jump Up: The warrior can regain his footing in an instant,
springing to his feet immediately if he is Knocked Down. The
warrior may ignore Knocked Down results when rolling for injuries,
unless he is Knocked Down because of a successful save from
wearing a helmet or because he has the No Pain special rule.
Dodge: A warrior with this skill is nimble and as fast as quicksilver.
He can avoid any hits from a missile weapon on a D6 roll of 5+.
Note that this roll is taken against missiles as soon as a hit is scored
to see whether the warrior dodges it or not, before rolling to wound,
and before any effects from other skills or equipment (such as lucky
charms).
Scale Sheer Surfaces: A warrior with this skill can scale even the
highest wall or fence with ease. He can climb up or down a height
equal to twice his normal Movement, and does not need to make
Initiative tests when doing so.
Fast Strike: The warrior may choose to make a single Fast Strike in
Hand-to-Hand instead of his normal complement of Attacks. The
warrior picks which weapon he is striking with and adds a d6 to his
Initiative to determine at what order the strike is resolved, max of

10. Not usable with any weapon that requires 2 Hands to use.
Roll Dodge: The warrior can ignore the 2" Interception rule when
charging in to Hand-to-Hand combat.
Fleet Footed: The warrior gains +1 to his base Movement.
Flee: If the Hero breaks and runs while in Hand-to-Hand combat,
his opponents do not get an automatic hit upon him. Rather, they hit
on a 4+. Additionally, the Hero's player may roll 3d6 instead of the
normal 2d6 and pick which 2 dice he prefers to determine the
number of inches the Hero flees.

#### Alchemy Ability

```
By Ed Hastings (killershrike@home.com)
Roll a D6 and consult the appropriate chart. If you get the same
Alchemy Ability twice, roll again or increase amount by 1 Dice, i.e.
D3 becomes 2D3, D6 becomes 2D6, etc
D6 Alchemy Ability

Flash Powder for use. Unused Flash Powder uses may be sold
for 15 gold each after the game.

must roll under their Toughness or become Stunned. Unused
sacks of Sleep Powder may be sold for 15 GC each after the
game.

without needing to roll to hit. Unused vials of Healing Potion
may be sold for 5 GC each after the game.

#### Assassin Special Skills

Backstabber: The Assassin specializes in attacking his targets when
their back is turned. The Assassin may charge an opponent he
cannot see (he knows you’re there!) as long as the target model is
within his charge reach. If he does this, he surprises his opponent
and receives a +1 to hit him with all attacks and any rolls on the
Serious Injuries chart are at +1. This bonus lasts for the first round
of combat only, as his opponent will swiftly recover his wits if he
survives the initial assault.
Silent Strike: As masters of camouflage the character is allowed to
charge out of hiding and strike silently at his opponent and then he
disappears into the shadows again. Roll a D6 on a 5+ the character
is allowed to charge and attack. The opponent(s) may strike back. If
uninjured, the character disappears to his original hiding place
again. The distance from hiding place and back into hiding, may not
exceed the characters maximum movement (2xM, or 3xM with
sprint, thus if more them half of the movement is spent to charge, no
hiding is possible anymore). If he fails the die roll he charges out
and it is treated like a normal charge.
Ultimate Kill: The assassin goes for the kill-spot, which is almost
an assured one way trip to the grave yard. The character in hand to
hand combat forgoes all extra Hand-to-Hand-attacks and
concentrates on one very well placed attack. The attack will be +1 to
hit, +1 to wound, +1 on the injury roll. This skill can only be used if
the character has 2 or more attacks on his profile. Does not work
together with Ultimate specialist or strike to injure. Does not work
with black powder weapons.
Master of Poisons: The assassin is a master in brewing up different
poisons. If the hero does not search for rare items, he has the time to
brew up 3D-1 portions of dark venom or black lotus. He can come
up empty, but those are the hazards of trying these intricate things
on the move. The portions are large enough for one weapon and
need to be used for the next battle as they are less stable then
normally purchased poisons.
Shadow Defence: As it is considered bad form to get injured on an
assignment there are special defensive moves that make an assassin
even better in surviving. The character is allowed to parry, with re-
roll, with any weapon he uses. If the weapon already has the ability
to parry, it is allowed to parry with an equal or higher dice roll,
which can also be re-rolled.
Hide in Shadows: The Assassin can blend into the shadows so that
his opponents will not see him. As long as he is within 1" of a wall
or other linear obstacle (hedge, fence, well, etc), opposing models
must pass an Initiative test in order to charge or shoot at him.
Ultimate Specialist: These characters are so highly trained that they
can use hand-to-hand weapons in a very efficient way. They gain
+1WS and +1 on the injury roll. Does not work together with
Ultimate Kill or Strike to Injure.
Infiltration: The Assassin with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.

#### Beastmen Raiders Special Skills

```
Shaggy Hide: The Beastman’s massively shaggy hide acts as
armour, deflecting sword strokes and protecting him from harm. The
model gains a 6+ Armour Save that can be combined with other
armour as normal.
Mutant: The Beastman may buy one mutation.
Fearless: Immune to Fear and All Alone tests.
Horned One: The Beastman has mighty horns, and can make an
additional Attack with its basic Strength on a turn it charges
Bellowing Roar: Only the Beastman Chief may have this skill. He
may re-roll any failed Rout tests.
Manhater: Will be affected by the rules of Hatred when fighting
any Human warbands.
```
#### Blessings of Nurgle

```
Those that worship at the fetid altar of the Lord of Decay suffer
from terrible diseases and decay, which are known as Blessings of
Nurgle.
Blessings of Nurgle may be bought for Tainted Ones only when
they are recruited; you may not buy new Blessings for a model after
recruitment. Any Tainted may have one or more Blessings. The first
Blessing is bought at the price indicated, but second and subsequent
Blessings cost double.
Stream of Corruption: The Tainted One can spew forth a
grotesque stream of maggots, entrails and filth. This is counted as a
shooting attack with a range of 6" and is resolved at Strength 3 with
no saves for armour.
Cost: 25 Gold Crowns
Nurgle’s Rot: The Tainted One is infected with the deadly
pestilence of its lord – Nurgle’s Rot. In addition, the Tainted One is
immune to all poisons. Nurgle’s Rot is a deadly contagion for which
there is no known cure. This virulent disease can be passed on in
hand-to-hand combat. If the Tainted One makes a successful to hit
roll of 6 this will result in the target model contracting the Rot (note:
Nurgle’s Rot only affects the living, so Undead, Daemons and the
Possessed are unaffected). Once a warrior has contracted the Rot,
mark this on the warband roster. Rather than killing the victim
immediately, the Rot can take some time to set in. From now on,
before the start of each battle, the warrior must pass a Toughness
test. If successful, his constitution has managed to stave off the
Rot’s effects. If unsuccessful, the warrior loses one point of
Toughness permanently (if he reaches zero, he has succumbed to the
Rot and died, remove him from the roster). In addition, if a 6 is
rolled for the Toughness test then he has unwittingly passed the Rot
on to another member of the warband (randomly allocate a warband
member and mark this on the roster).
Cost: 50 Gold Crowns
Cloud of Flies: The Tainted One is surrounded by a cloud of flies,
which buzz around him and his combat opponent. They do not affect
the Tainted One but distract foes by buzzing into eyes, nostrils and
mouths. The Tainted One’s close combat opponent suffers a -1 to hit
modifier on all attacks.
Cost: 25 Gold Crowns
Bloated Foulness: The Tainted One is a huge, disgusting mass of
diseased, flabby folds. It gains +1 Wound and +1 Toughness but has
its Movement reduced by -1.
Cost: 40 Gold Crowns
Mark of Nurgle: The Tainted One is burned with the great mark of
Nurgle, the three spheres, that weep foul pus constantly. It gains +1
Wound and is immune to all poisons.
Cost: 35 Gold Crowns
Hideous: The Tainted One is so disgusting that its flesh hangs in
tatters from its body and its entrails are rotten and exposed. It causes
Fear.
Cost: 40 Gold Crowns
```

#### Blood Dragon’s Bloodline Abilities

By Natascha Chrobok
Red Fury: The vampire falls in a horrible blood-rage, unstoppable
for his enemies. He gains one additional Attack to his profile.
Killing Blow: The vampire is an expert fighter and every time he
rolls a natural 6 on the to-hit roll, he automatically wounds his
opponent. No parries are allowed, although the opponent may make
armour or saving throws.
Master Strike: The vampire has an uncanny knack of hitting his
victims where it will do most damage. He may cause a critical hit on
a 5 or 6.
Curse Of The Undead: The vampire is one of the ever-living and is
extraordinarily difficult to kill. The vampire has 5+ ward save in
addition to all his armour-rolls and parries.
Strength of the Dragon: The vampire is extremely strong. He gains
a +1 Strength bonus and gets no movement penalties for wearing
heavy armour and shield.
Gift of Abhorash: The vampire is a very imposing leader and
permanently raises the maximum number of Members in the
warband by D3.

#### Bretonnian Knights Special Skills

Virtue of Purity: Any spell cast against the Knight will be dispelled
on the D6 roll of a 4+.
Virtue of Valour: The Knight may re-roll any missed to hit rolls
against an enemy with a higher strength.
Virtue of Discipline: Once per game, if the Knight is not Out Of
Action, Stunned or Knocked Down, you may re-roll a failed Rout
Test
Virtue of Noble Disdain: The Knight is subject to Hatred of all
enemies armed with shooting weapons.
Virtue of the Impetuous: The Knight gains an additional +D3" to
his move when charging. Roll the dice each time you wish to charge
and before moving the model.

#### Cavalry Skills

```
Skills may only be used one at a time. If two are applicable to a
given situation, the controlling player must decide which to use.
All bonuses are cumulative with those gained from a mount,
unless otherwise stated.
Cavalry Commander. Mounted heroes are an impressive sight.
With a good vantage point, they can see (and be seen) far more
readily than if they were on foot. If the warband's leader has this
skill and is mounted, he may add an extra 6" to the distance within
which other warriors in the warband may use his Leadership. This is
in addition to any other bonuses that increase the range of the
leader’s influence.
Trick Riding. By athletically hanging off the side of his mount, a
rider makes himself harder to hit. While a rider is trick riding all
missile attacks against him suffer -1 to hit in addition to other
modifiers. The rider must declare that he is trick riding before
moving. He must then make an initiative test and if successful may
move full distance. If he fails he loses control of his mount and must
roll immediately on the Whoa Boy! Table. This skill may not be
used with heavy armour because of the agility required. In addition,
trick riding requires both hands, so the model may not use a shield
or missile weapons whilst using the skill. Warriors without Ride
may not use this skill.
Combat Riding. The rider has trained his mount to use its bulk to
trample any unmounted enemy before him. A warrior with this skill
may make a single additional S4 attack when charging an
unmounted opponent. In subsequent rounds of combat, or if charged
by enemy warriors, the mounted warrior fights as normal.
Evade. The rider has trained his mount to swerve from side to side
in combat, wrong footing his opponent. A rider with this skill
always strikes first in close combat against dismounted opponents.
When charged by an opponent, or otherwise fighting an enemy also
entitled to strike first, attacks are carried out in order of Initiative. If
Initiative is equal, the model with greater experience strikes first.
Warriors without Ride may not use this skill.
Running Dismount. The rider is able to dismount from his mount
at speed. The rider may ride up to the mount’s normal move
distance and then dismount immediately. No further movement or
shooting is possible. This skill may be used to move into contact
with the enemy, counting as a Diving Charge from a height of 2" –
all usual rules for diving charges apply. Note that the rider then
counts as dismounted, gaining no further assistance from his mount.
Warriors without Ride may not use this skill.
Athletic Mount. Without breaking stride, the warrior is able to leap
onto the back of his mount and immediately spur it into a full gallop.
Once the warrior is aboard, the mount may make a run or charge
move as normal. The warrior must be within 2" of his steed to use
this skill.
Horse Archer. The rider has learned the skills of the steppe nomads
and can shoot from a running mount. The rider may shoot in a 360
degree arc whilst mounted, and may shoot while his mount is
running; however the shot suffers a -1 to hit penalty in addition to
all other normal modifiers. Warriors without Ride may not use this
skill.
Mounted Combat Master. The rider is especially skilled at combat
against a mounted opponent. If the model is fighting mounted
against a mounted opponent and successfully wounds the enemy, the
wounded model must add +1 to his roll on the Whoa Boy! Table.
Warriors without Ride may not use this skill.

#### Clan Eshin Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armour save possible at the end of the turn.
Tail Fighting: The Skaven may wield a shield, knife or a sword
with its tail. The model gains an extra attack with the appropriate
weapon or a +1 bonus to its armour save.
Wall Runner: The Skaven does not need to take an Initiative test
when climbing up walls and other sheer surfaces. Suggested
Changes: May run or charge up walls, always striking last when
charging in this manner.
Infiltration: A Skaven with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Art of Silent Death: The Skaven has patiently mastered the deadly
art of open-hand fighting, as taught by the mystics of Cathay in the
temples of the far East. In hand-to-hand combat, the Skaven can
fight with his bare paws without any penalties and counts as having
two weapons (i.e., +1 attack). In addition, a Skaven Hero with this
skill will cause a critical hit on a To Wound roll of 5-6 instead of
just 6. This skill may be used in conjunction with the Eshin Fighting
Claws (+2 Attacks instead of +1).
Play Dead: Sometimes strange things happen when people have the
misfortune of running into Skaven. A clearly dead corpse is not
there anymore after the fight is over, or dropped weapons or
treasures have disappeared. As well as being taught to roll with the
blows, these characters are taught to feign death. When avoiding the
full effects of a potentially lethal blow they play dead so they can
escape undetected later. The character may re-roll a result on the
serious injury table.

#### Clan Moulder Special Skill

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armour save possible at the end of the turn.
Tail Fighting: The Skaven may wield a shield, knife or a sword
with its tail. The model gains an extra attack with the appropriate
weapon or a +1 bonus to its armour save.
Wall Runner: The Skaven does not need to take an Initiative test
when climbing up walls and other sheer surfaces. Suggested
Changes: May run or charge up walls, always striking last when
charging in this manner.
Infiltration: A Skaven with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Beast Master: Any animals (giant rats, rat wolves, and rat ogres) in
the same warband as the Skaven with this skill are treated as having
a +1 bonus to their Leadership.

###### Clan Moulder Mutation

anyone in base contact with the model suffers a Strength 3 hit (no
critical hits) from the spurting, corrosive blood.

Cost: 40 gold crowns.
Long Legs: The mutant gains +1 Movement.
Cost: 40 gold crowns.
Poisoned Barb: The mutant has a long, poisoned stinger at the end
of its tail. This allows him to make an extra Strength 5 attack in each

the Strength of the hit is reduced to 2.
Cost: 40 gold crowns.
Prehensile Tail: The mutant’s tail has been lengthened and
strengthened until is a frightening addition to his physical makeup.
He may grapple his opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks
by –1, down to a minimum of 1. The mutant may decide which
attack his opponent loses.
Cost: 35 gold crowns.

#### Clan Pestilens Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armour save possible at the end of the turn.
Censer Bearer: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Black
Hunger special skill may choose the Censer Bearer special skill. A
Clan Pestilens member with this skill is called Censer Bearer. He
gains the special rule Frenzy and the only weapon he may use in
close combat is a censer.
Contagious: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Rotten Body
special skill may choose the Contagious special skill. A model who
inflicts an injury in close combat that send the contagious member
of the Clan Pestilens out of combat must take a Toughness test. Roll
a D6. If the result is higher than the Toughness of the model taking
the test, he will suffer an automatic wound. A result of 6 always
inflicts a wound. Models of undead and possessed never take this
test.
Diseased Visage: The follower of the Plagued Ones with this
attribute has obtained a body and face covered in oozing sores and
legions so horrible, that the model causes fear.
Ignore Pain: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Resilient
strength skill may choose the Ignore Pain special skill. A Clan
Pestilens member with this skill treats "Stunned" injuries as
"Knocked Down".
Rotten Body: A Clan Pestilens member with this skill has grown
accustomed to poisons, diseases and the fog of death emanated by
censers. He is now immune to poisons and diseases and, if taken out
of combat because of a failed test for wielding a censer, he will not
have to roll for injuries at the end of the battle, recovering
automatically.
Unholy Chant: Once per battle, the model with this skill may start
an Unholy Chant. This chant causes all Skaven in the warband to
immediately pass all Leadership-based tests in the turn the chant is
uttered, including Rout tests.

#### Clan Skryre Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armour save possible at the end of the turn.
Tail Fighting: The Skaven may wield a shield, knife or a sword
with its tail. The model gains an extra attack with the appropriate
weapon or a +1 bonus to its armour save.

when climbing up walls and other sheer surfaces. Suggested
Changes: May run or charge up walls, always striking last when
charging in this manner.
Infiltration: A Skaven with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Excellent Engineer: The Skryre Engineer with this skill is
constantly working on the black powder and Warplock weapons of
the warband. Any black powder or Warplock weapons owned by the
Skaven in the warband have their range increased by +6”.
Warp Magic (magic user only): The Skaven may now uses magic
from the any Skaven magic list or Lesser Magic List.

#### Dark Elf Special Skills

```
Draich Master: The hero has chosen the aspect of the Executioner
as his primary focus. The hero can wield a double-handed sword
without the usual penalty of striking last, and is allowed to wear
Heavy or Ithilmar armour (note that he may not wear Gromril
armour; what kind of Elf would wear Dwarf-made armour,
anyways?). [Skill by Julian Hellstrom]
Fey Quickness: Few can ever hope to match an Elf ’s inhuman
quickness and agility. An Elf with Fey Quickness can avoid melee
or missile attacks on a roll of 6. If the Elf also has Step Aside or
Dodge this will increase to a 4+ in the relevant area. For example,
an Elf with Fey Quickness and Step Aside avoids melee attacks on a
4+ and missile attacks on a 6.
Fury of Khaine: The Dark Elf is infused with an intense raging
thirst for blood and is a whirlwind in hand-to-hand combat, moving
from opponent to opponent. The Dark Elf may make a 4" follow up
move if he takes all of his opponents Out Of Action. If he comes
into contact with another enemy this starts a new combat. This new
combat takes place in the following turn and the model counts as
charging. May not follow up in the opponent’s turn.
Infiltration: The Dark Elf with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Lethal Strike: This Dark Elf has come far in his training, and is a
skilled practitioner of torture; the Hero knows exactly where to hit
his foes to cause maximum damage. He can cause a Critical Hit on a
to wound roll of 5-6, instead of only 6. If he needs a 6 to wound the
target, he can still cause a Critical Hit on a to wound roll of 6. [Skill
by Julian Hellstrom]
Master of Poisons: The Dark Elf is proficient in concocting
different poisons. If the Hero doesn’t search for rare items, he may
make D3-1 doses of Dark Venom instead. There is a chance of
getting none, as the hero doesn’t have access to a stable workplace.
The poison must be used in the next battle and cannot be sold or
traded to other warbands as the Dark Elves guard their secrets very
carefully.
Powerful Build: The warrior is strongly built for an Elf and is
capable of feats of strength. A warrior with this skill may choose
skills from the Strength table. The Sorceress may never take this
skill and no more than two warriors in the warband may take this
skill at any one time.

#### Dirty Tricks Special Skills

By Archeonicus (Harrald.Faessen@dsm-group.com)
Battle... two groups who are fighting each other for a reason. More
times, then not, people tend to do things to win, which a lot of other
people would consider cheating. Either by non-spoken rules, official
rules, or even taboos. In war those examples are manifold, were
kicking somebody in the groin would be one of the least offences.
Warbands will go, or maybe can go, very far in this. So what does
this all leads to?
Kick in the family jewels: (Now I’m getting in uncharted territory
here, but someone once said to that this is painful for women too,
not just that devastating in the long run). Instead of making your
normal attacks, you are allowed ONE kick between your opponents
spread legs. Use the WS. You get +1 to hit, if this attack is not used
this battle before. Treat knockdown results as stunned. This affects
everyone except zombies, sexless beings and people in Heavy
armour. (yes, now you know the place to stun a vampire).
Biting: (this ought to make up something for the vampire :-) Instead
of your attacks you may try to bite your CC-opponent. Jawmuscles
tend to be very powerful, so watch your teeth. People who bite tend
to find unarmored places. This is a S3 attack with no armour save
allowed. A successful hit means that the victim suffers the next
round a S2 autohit and following turn a S1 hit. This is due to blood
(or other fluid) loss.
Sand in the eyes: When you are knocked down, instead of using
your attacks on the round you stand up, you may try to throw sand
in your opponent’s eyes. Use BS, on a successful hit opponent is
hitting/shooting at –1. This is treated in initiative sequence and not
like normal: attack last. Opponent with sand in his eyes may roll D6
to see if it is rubbed out. First consecutive round roll 4+ D6 to see
normally. Every next round add +1 to the roll.

#### Dwarf Special Skills

Master of Blades: This Dwarf’s martial skills surpass those of a
normal warrior; he has fought unscathed against hordes of Orcs and
Goblins. When using a weapon that has a Parry special rule, this
hero parries successfully if he beats or matches his opponents
highest ‘to hit’ roll, not just if he beats the roll. In addition, if this
warrior is using two weapons that have the Parry special rule, he is
allowed to parry two attacks (if his two dice match or beat the two
highest Attack dice against him) instead of the normal maximum of
one. Note that if this Dwarf has two Dwarf axes (as detailed above)
he can re-roll any failed parries.
Extra Tough: This Dwarf is notorious for walking away from
wounds that would kill a lesser being. When rolling on the Heroes
Serious Injury chart for this Hero after a game in which he has been
taken Out Of Action, the dice may be re-rolled once. The result of
this second dice roll must be accepted, even if it is a worse result.
Resource Hunter: This Dwarf is especially good at locating
valuable resources. When rolling on the Exploration chart at the end
of a game, the Hero may modify one dice roll by +1/-1.
True Grit: Dwarfs are hardy individuals and this Hero is hardy
even for a Dwarf! When rolling on the Injury table for this Hero, a
roll of 1-3 is treated as Knocked Down, 4-5 as Stunned, and 6 as Out
Of Action.
Thick Skull: The Hero has a thick skull, even for a Dwarf. He has a
3+ save on a D6 to avoid being Stunned. If the save is made, treat a
Stunned result as Knocked Down instead. If the Dwarf also wears a
helmet, this save is 2+ instead of 3+ (this takes the place of the
normal Helmet special rule).

#### Far-sight Ability

```
By Ed Hastings (killershrike@home.com)
Roll a D6 and consult the appropriate chart. If you get the same Far-
sight Ability twice, roll again or lower the Far-sight Ability’s
difficulty by 1.
D6 Far-sight Ability
1 Flash of Insight: Difficulty: Auto
Up to D3 models of the warband may be positioned anywhere
on the board outside of the enemies sight and detection ranges
after all opponents have set up.
2 Sixth Sense: Difficulty: 9
4+ Unmodified save vs. any Hostile effect. Lasts for the
duration of the game after cast.
3 Prescient: Difficulty: Auto
If rolling for a scenario, the Seers warband may choose whether

Should an opposing warband have a simialar ability, roll a die
and add the I of each warbands leader. High roll picks.
4 Clairsentient: Difficulty: 7

models on the board and can point them out to fellow band
members within 6" of him. Hidden models no longer count as
hidden until they can legally regain that status later.
5 Dire Warning: Difficulty: Auto
One Hero or Warrior (including hirelings) has been warned to
beware of death. Having taken due precaution, one Hero may
reroll his first Serious Injury result OR 1 Henchman or Hireling

roll stands.
6 Foretold: Difficulty 11
The Seer may foretell an enemies misfortune. A chosen enemy

#### Halfling Special Skills

Quiet as a Mouse: The Halfling as adept at staying as quiet as a
mouse whilst hiding. Enemy warriors must use half their initiative
value in inches (rounded down) when trying to detect this hidden
Halfling.
Crude Belch: Having eaten a meal or six, this Halfling may release
a withering belch to distract his enemies. During the first round of
hand to hand combat the Halfling can release his noxious fumes
upon all enemies within base contact. All enemies affected must
take a leadership test. If the leadership test is failed then the putrid
odour has severely affected the warrior's fighting ability and he must
miss his first attack (regardless of whether he has only one attack or
not).
Skilled Huntsman: The Halfling has been hunting things ever since
he was young (the more food he has, the better!) and has become
well adapted to firing as silently and discreetly as possible. To
represent this a Halfling may try and fire a ranged weapon and
remain hidden. When shooting from hiding roll D6. On a 3+ the
Halfling has managed to keep his actions inconspicuous to the eye
of the enemy and may remain hidden that turn. Note this skill may
not be combined with black powder weapons, they are just too
noisy!
Layers of Fat: The Halfling has gained mountains of flab during his
vast experience of eating fine foods and his thick bulk could
swallow a sword whole! The Halfling always has a basic saving
throw of 6 regardless of the enemy warrior's strength and on top of
any armour he already wears.
Shifty: The Halfling has long-been skirting in the shadows,
avoiding unwanted attention. So nimble is he that he may surprise
even those who believe they've got them dead-to-rights. The
Halfling gains a bonus attack when charged that strikes first.
Wily Thief: If the Halfling takes any enemy out of action and
doesn’t go out of action himself, the warband gains an extra piece of
Wyrdstone (in addition to his Cutpurse piece. See Halfling thief)
Stealthy: The Halfling can hide even after running, and can run
while within 8” of the enemy.

#### Hobgoblin Special Skills

Charge Stoppa: A hobgoblin with this skill can deliver a huge
surprise to a charging opponent. When an opponent charges the
hobgoblin he can immediately make a free attack with a missile
weapon. If the hobgoblin’s strike causes him an injury, the attacker
is stopped halfway through his charge. For example, if the charge
would have been 8”, the hobgoblin’s strike would stop the attacker
at 4 inches. Unfortunately for the hobgoblin, if his assailant does
succeed in his charge, the hobgoblin cannot use hand-to-hand
combat weapons during that round. He can use his fist however.
Ded Shooty: Hobgoblins are famed masters of the bow, and their
steady aim allows them to fire with uncanny accuracy while on the
move. This skill allows a hobgoblin to ignore movement penalties
when shooting. Hobgoblins riding giant wolves can use this skill as
well, suffering no penalties to movement while firing from
wolfback.
Ded Sneaky: These sneaky hobgoblins have been trained as scouts,
sneaking up close to the enemy to deliver a deadly strike or observe
the enemy positions for their leaders. A hobgoblin with this skill is
placed after all other models have been placed. He can be placed
anywhere on the table, as long as he’s at least 12” from any
opponent’s models.
Backstabba: The hobgoblins are a tricky breed, and take advantage
of any opportunity in combat. A hobgoblin with this skill can make
a surprise attack on his opponent from a direction he isn’t expecting.
The attack is in addition to the hobgoblin’s normal attacks, but
cannot be parried.

#### Kislev Ranger Skills

```
Animal Call: If hidden, the Ranger may use animal calls to
confound the enemies. Any enemy model that is within 18” of the
Ranger and does not declare a charge in its movement phase must
take a Leadership test (determine which models these are after
charges are declared but before they are moved). Those that fail the
Ranger may move in any direction she wishes instead of their
normal move.
Herb Lore: The Ranger has learned basic herb lore to cure injuries.
Any friendly model in base-to-base contact with her may have 1
wound restored on a roll of 4+ in the recovery phase. The ranger
may also heal herself. If any healing is successful, the ranger may
not move this turn, but may shoot as normal. The ranger may not
heal if she is in close combat.
```
#### Lahmia Special Skills

```
By the Khemri guys http://grafixgibs.tripod.com/Khemri/index.htm
Swift: when moving the vampire may run but counts as having
moved normally for all purposes.
Transfix: at the start of the combat phase, one enemy model in base
contact must test against Leadership. If the test is failed, the model
may not attack that turn and all attacks against it gain an additional
+1 to hit. Ineffective against models immune to psychology.
Quickblood: the vampire's lightning reflexes give it an
unmodifiable 6+ save against all wounds. This save is in addition to
and taken before normal armour saves. Note that in the case of
critical hits this save is taken before rolling to see if multiple
wounds are taken. If the vampire acquires Dodge or Step Aside,
those skills supercede this one and cannot be combined to produce a
4+ save. Hence, a vampire with Quickblood and Dodge has a 5+
save against missiles and 6+ against close combat.
Innocence Lost: the vampire's ability to appear virginal and
innocent temporarily disarms her opponent. The vampire always
attacks first in close combat. If an enemy model also has the ability
to attack first, then decide in order of initiative. In case of equal
initiative, the highest score on 1d6 goes first. This skill is ineffective
against models immune to psychology.
Seduction: The vampire must test against Leadership at the start of
the combat phase. If successful, one enemy model in base contact
must also save against Leadership. If failed, the model is controlled
by the vampire player. The model's original owner may attempt to
regain control in each subsequent turn by testing again in his
recovery phase. If the vampire chooses to attack the controlled
model, control is lost immediately. If the model ends the game
under vampire control, they count as out of action. A maximum of
one model may be so controlled. Ineffective against models immune
to psychology.
Night Creature: the vampire blends effortlessly into the
background. Models wishing to charge, shoot or cast spells at the
vampire must roll 4+ to do so, or choose another target. This skill is
only effective if the vampire did not move in its previous movement
phase.

#### Marks of Chaos

Mark of Chaos Undivided: For the Model bearing this mark may
add +1 to his leadership tests, a 1 will always fail.
Mark of Khorne: For the Model bearing this mark are Frenzy and a
have natural 5 +save against all magic. If taken by a magic user
model, the model will lose the ability to cast spells.
Mark of Nurgle: For the Model bearing this mark may increase the
toughness (T) and wounds (W) maximum by 1. All attacks are
poisoned (as black lotus)
Mark of Slaanesh: For the Model bearing this mark all enemies
must past a leadership test to charge. All the enemies’ attacks suffer
a -1 to hit in close combat.
Mark of Tzeentch: For the Model bearing this mark may have one
spell from the Chaos Rituals or the Lesser Magic list (may cast
spells while wearing armour). The model counts as a magic user.

#### Musicians Skills

By Steven (Grafix) Gibbs
Minstrel: The musician is a masterful taleteller and gains extra
income for the warband. Add 2d6 gold to coffers between battles.
Fighting Songs: The musician has in his selection of songs many a
fighting ballad. These ballads dispel fear. Any musician with this
ability sings in battle emboldening the troops. Any friendly troop
within 12” does not suffer from fear or all alone tests.
Charisma: A musician with this ability attracts others to the
warband. He also is able to rally the troops when they might flee.
You may add 1 warrior to your warband and may reroll any failed
rout test. The second test stands.
Cacophony: The musician is able to create awful noises with his
instrument or voice causing anyone within 6” to run in fear.
(including those immune to psychology)
Lore: The musician knows the lore of the area and may +/- 1 from
one die roll when searching.
Master of Lore: The musician knows the lore of the area very well
and may add one die when searching. The musician may only gain
this skill if he has Lore.

#### Mutations

```
Those who dwell in Mordheim soon develop horrible mutations, and
the Cult of the Possessed seem to be especially susceptible. In
addition, Mordheim attracts mutants from all over the Empire, who
are always quick to join the Chaos covens. Most mutations are
simply inconvenient or hideous, but some make their bearers
extremely dangerous in combat.
Mutations may be bought for a Mutant or a Possessed warrior only
when they are recruited; you may not buy new mutations for a
model after recruitment. Any Mutant or Possessed may have one or
more mutations. The first mutation is bought at the price indicated,
but second and subsequent mutations bought for the same model
cost double.
Daemon soul: A Daemon lives within the mutant’s soul. This gives
him a 4+ save against the effects of spells or prayers.
Cost: 20 gold crowns.
Great claw: One of the mutant’s arms ends in a great, crab-like
claw. He may carry no weapons in this arm, but gains an extra
attack in hand-to-hand combat with a +1 Strength bonus.
Cost: 50 gold crowns.
Cloven hoofs: The warrior gains +1 Movement.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Tentacle: One of the mutant’s arms ends in a tentacle. He may
grapple his opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks by -1,
down to a minimum of 1. The mutant may decide which attack his
opponent loses.
Cost: 35 gold crowns
Blackblood: If the model loses a wound in close combat, anyone in
base contact with the model suffers a Strength 3 hit (no critical hits)
from the spurting corrosive blood.
Cost: 30 gold crowns
Spines: Any model in base contact with the mutant suffers an
automatic Strength 1 hit at the beginning of each close combat
phase. Spines will never cause critical hits.
Cost: 35 gold crowns
Scorpion tail: The mutant has a long barbed tail with a venomed
tip, allowing him to make an extra Strength 5 attack in each hand-to-
hand combat phase. If the model hit by the tail is immune to poison,
the Strength of the hit is reduced to 2.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Extra arm: The mutant may use any single-handed weapon in the
extra arm, giving him +1 attack when fighting in hand-to-hand
combat. Alternatively, he may carry a shield or a buckler in the extra
arm. If a Possessed chooses to do this, he gains an extra attack but
still cannot carry a weapon.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Hideous: The mutant causes fear. See the Psychology section for
details.
Cost: 40 gold crowns

#### Norse Special Skill

Shield Master: Norse warriors begin training with shields when
they are still children. Some warriors become so skilled with these
weapons that they can block almost any blow against them. When
this hero is armed with a shield he may parry with it in addition to
getting a 6+ save.
Berserk Charge: The Norse are very skilled with weapons that
many other races see as primitive and savage. When this hero is
armed with an axe or double handed weapon, he may re-roll all
failed to hit rolls when he charges.
Crushing Blow: Norse warriors train in almost all of their spare
time. They are expert fighters and learn to put all of their strength
into very powerful attacks. No enemy may parry an attack made by
this hero because it strikes with such power that it pushes right
threw a buckler or sword.
Battle Tongue: Only a hero with the leader skill may gain this skill.
It allows models within 12" of him use his leadership, rather than
the normal 6".
Barbarian Courage: As Norse warriors strive to die bravely in
battle, they learn to fear nothing and embrace hardship. This hero
never needs to take all alone tests and may re-roll failed fear tests.

#### Orcs Special Skills

’ard ead: The warrior has a thick skull even for an Orc. He has a
special 3+ save on a D6 to avoid being Stunned. If the save is made,
treat a Stunned result as Knocked Down instead. If the Orc also
wears a helmet, this save is 2+ instead of 3+ (this takes the place of
the normal helmet special rule).
Waaagh!: Orcs are aggressive creatures and some are experts at
bulldozing charges. The warrior may add +D3" to his charge range.
’ere we go!: Orcs often charge even the most fearsome opponents.
The model may ignore Fear and Terror tests when charging.
da cunnin’ plan: Only the Boss may have this skill. The warband
may re-roll any failed Rout tests as long as the Boss is not Out Of
Action.
well ’ard (Greenskin warband only): The Orc has a thick, dark-
green skin, possibly indicating Black Orc blood. Such is the
toughness of the Orc that he may add +1 to any armour saves.
Proven Warrior (Black Orc Warband only): This young warrior
has proven himself worthy of his Black Orc heritage. This skill may
only be taken by a Young’un with the Black Orc blood ability and
25 experience. Once he gains this skill, the model is now considered
a full Black Orc Warrior (yet still retains the title of Young’un). He
follows all the rules for Black Orcs and uses their equipment list and
has access to the same skill lists as a Black Orc.
’eadbasher: Orcs have massive physical strength and some of them
even learn to aim their blows at the heads of their opponents, with
obvious results. Any Knocked Down results which the Orc causes in
hand-to-hand count as Stunned results instead.

#### Ostlanders Special Skills

```
Bull Rush: This warrior is huge, even by Ostlander standards, and
can use his massive girth to overpower his opponents. When he
charges, this Hero may attempt to knock down his opponent rather
than making his normal attacks. Roll to hit once with a +1 to hit
modifier, though no ‘to wound’ roll is necessary. Instead, if the
warrior hits with this attack, the opposing model is Knocked Down.
(Models with the Bull Rush skill should have a suitably large beer-
belly modeled out of putty whenever possible.)
Foul Odor: Ostlanders are one and all prodigious drinkers and none
too hygienic! This warrior rises head and shoulders above the rest.
After a lifetime of drinking, liquor has little effect on him any
more... not that this stops him from consuming massive quantities!
His unwashed clothes and sweat reek of alcohol and all living
enemies (not Undead or Possessed) are at -1 to hit him in hand-to-
hand combat. In addition, the warrior cannot carry any open flames
(torch, lantern, etc.) and fire attacks made against him are resolved
at +1 Strength as his beer soaked clothing burns readily.
Taunt: After years of baiting opponents into drunken brawls the
Ostlander has learned some of most vile insults in the Empire.
During the shooting phase the warrior may choose to taunt one
enemy instead of shooting with a missile weapon or casting a spell.
The warrior must be able to see the enemy and taunting follows all
the LOS rules for shooting (you must taunt the nearest opponent,
etc.). The player should insult the enemy model in some manner
whenever possible (perhaps his hat looks like a strangled parrot or
his mother was a Bretonnian.). The enemy then takes a Leadership
test. If he passes, nothing happens but if he fails he must spend his
next movement phase trying to get into close combat with the
warrior who taunted him.
Animal Friendship: Having grown up amidst the animals of the
forest this warrior exudes a certain charm to all ‘normal’ animals
(i.e. warhorses, Warhounds, etc.). Animals will never attack him and
up to two War dogs (see Mordheim book, page 54) that the warrior
owns do not count against the maximum number of models in the
Warband.
Blood Oath: The leader of an Ostlander Warband sometimes takes
a Blood Oath never to leave any of his fallen ‘family’ members
behind. Such is his determination to protect his fallen Blood-kin that
it is extremely difficult to cause him to Rout from the field. Only a
Warband’s leader may have this skill, which allows him to re-roll a
single Rout test once per game.
```

#### Pit Fighters Special Skills

Bulging Biceps: The Pit Fighter may ignore the entire ‘heavy’
weapons special rule penalty. The Strength bonus will now apply to
all rounds in CC. So a Morning Star will give +1 Strength in all
turns not only the first one.
Force of Will: When the Pit Fighter loses his last wound and is
taken OOA, he must roll a D6 equal or under his Toughness, each
following round he has to roll again on his toughness but then with a
-1 modifier for each subsequent round. If he succeeds he gets up and
may continue to fight, when he gets taken Out -of-Action a second
time he’ll be removed as normal.
Arms master: The Pit Fighter may now ignore all ‘difficult to use’
rules for all weapons, this enables him to combine certain types of
weapons, he can combine a Morning Star with buckler, or even a
Morning Star with a Morning Star.
Body Slam: Instead of making a normal charge the Pit Fighter may
attempt to slam his opponent to the ground, he burrows his shoulder
deep into his opponent’s stomach. Instead of making his normal
attacks the Pit fighter may make a single attack resolved as
following: +1Str, +1 to Hit, no weapon bonuses or abilities. Critical
hit on a 5+.
Grizzled Veteran: The Pit Fighter is used to fighting fearsome
monsters and being cornered in the Pit when there's no escape. He
has been close to death so many times that he has made his peace
and the thought of Death no longer bothers him. The Pit Fighter is
immune to all psychology.

#### Sewer Fighter Special Skills

By Christian Ellegaard
Agile: The Hero may run over wooden planks without having to
take Initiative tests to see if he crashes through.
Brave Eye: The Hero's eyes rarely disappoint, and thus he may re-
roll any initial Line of Sight rolls if he is not satisfied with the first
result. However, he must accept the latter result regardless if it is
worse than the first.
Control: The Hero has gotten used to the special conditions in the
sewers, and he has understood to ignore things that would scare
others to death. Therefore the Hero may use his standard Leadership
without any penalties.
Nerves of steel: The Henchmen have gotten tougher, and more than
slightly dripping water must cause them to run away. Thus a
Henchman group with the Nerves of Steel skill may re-roll any
failed Leadership rolls to see if they may move.
Night sight: After hours of wandering about in the darkness of the
sewers, the Hero has developed a slight night sight. He may add
+D6 to his initial Line of Sight.
Sure feet: The warriors have learned how to run over the rotten
planks without crashing through. A warrior with the Sure Feet skill
may re-roll a failed Initiative test when running over wooden planks.

#### Sisters of Sigmar Special Skills

```
Sign of Sigmar: The Sister is favoured by the great god Sigmar.
Possessed or Undead opponents lose their first attack against the
Priestess in the first round of hand-to-hand combat (down to a
minimum of 1).
Protection of Sigmar: The Sister has been blessed by the High
Matriarch. Any spell which would affect her is nullified on a D6 roll
of 4+. Note that if the spell is nullified it will not affect any other
models either.
Utter Determination: Only the Matriarch may have this skill,
which allows her to re-roll any failed Rout tests.
Righteous Fury: The Sister feels cold fury and utter contempt
towards any evil that pollutes the soil of the holy Empire with its
presence. The model hates all Skaven, Undead or Possessed
warbands and all models in them.
Absolute Faith: The Sister puts her faith in Sigmar, and faces
dangers unflinchingly. She may re-roll any Fear tests and does not
have to test if she is fighting alone against several opponents.
```
#### Shadow Warrior Special Skills

```
Infiltration: A Shadow Warrior with this skill is always placed on
the battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed
anywhere on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing
warband and more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both
players have models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the
lowest roll sets up first.
See in Shadows: The warrior’s senses have become especially keen
from years spent walking the shadows. As long as he has movement
to reach them, the warrior may always roll to charge opponents he
cannot see (instead of the normal 4").
Hide in Shadows: Over time Shadow Warriors have learned how to
freeze in place and remain undetected, even from the heightened
senses of their Dark Elf cousins. An enemy warrior attempting to
detect this warrior when he is Hidden must halve his Initiative
before measuring the distance.
Sniper: Long years of guerrilla warfare against the Dark Elves have
taught Shadow Warriors how to strike from the shadows without
being seen. If Hidden, a warrior with this skill may shoot or cast
spells and still remain Hidden.
Powerful Build: The warrior is strongly built for an Elf, and is
capable of feats of strength not often seen among the people of
Ulthuan. A warrior with this skill may choose skills from the
Strength skills table from now on. This skill may not be taken by
Shadow Weavers. There may never be more than two Elves with
this skill in the warband at any one time.
Master of Runes: The Shadow Weaver has learned to harness the
power of the High Elven runes of power (see Elven Runestones,
below) to a degree few mages attain. When using Elven Runestones,
the mage is +1 to his dispel roll. In addition, the mage can inscribe
the weapons and armour of one of his fellow warriors with Elven
runes. One member of the Warband may re-roll a single failed
armour save or Parry roll once per battle. After a single battle, the
runes lose their glamour and must be redone. This skill may only be
taken by Shadow Weavers.

#### Troll Slayer Special Skills

Ferocious Charge: The Slayer may double his attacks on the turn
that he charges. He will suffer a -1 to hit penalty on that turn.
Monster Slayer: The Slayer always wounds any opponent on a roll
of 4+, regardless of Toughness, unless his own Strength (after all
modifiers due to weapon bonuses, etc) would mean that a lower roll
than this is needed.
Berserker: The Slayer may add +1 to his close combat to hit rolls
during the turn which he charges. (may not be used with Ferocious
Charge).
Sweeping strike: The slayer may make get an extra attack for each
enemy model in base contact, if he is engaged by more than 1
model, up to a total of ten attacks.
Tattoos of Grimnir: The Slayer is tattooed by one of the Priests of
Grimnir the Brave, the God of Slayers. The model now has a 6+
ward save. You may take this skill again increased to 5+ and so on,
up to 3+. (The Slayer is then covered in tattoos!).
Fated: The Slayer is destined not to die easily. You may re-roll any
result on the Serious Injury table. The second result stands, even if it
is worse than the first one.

#### Von Carstein Special Skills

```
Transfixing Glare: The Vampire is able to hypnotize a victim using
his glowing red eyes, the victim will remain passive and wait for the
Vampire to close. The Glare may be used on any living model in
base contact that is not Immune to Psychology. The victim must
pass a Leadership test on a 2D6 or be transfixed. A transfixed model
may not attack in close combat and is treated as being Knocked
Down for purpose of being attacked. Roll for the Glare at the start of
the combat phase.
Mist Form: A Vampire's human form is only one of many and a
few can transform into a thin mist in the recovery phase. While in
this state the Vampire has a move of 2D6" per turn. He may not
attack in close combat, shoot with a missile weapon or cast spells
and he gains no protection from armour. All to hit rolls against the
Vampire need a natural '6' to hit and all to wound rolls need a
natural '6 '. Note that this may not be modified by any bonuses as it
represents the protection of a non-physical form. The Vampire may
reduce the injury roll by -2. If the Vampire is Knocked Down he
immediately reverts to his physical form. The Vampire may change
back to Vampire form in any subsequent recovery phase by choice.
Ratswarm Form: Some Vampires hold a sway over nature and they
can transform into animals such as a wolf, a swarm of rats or a giant
bat. A Vampire can change form in the recovery phase regardless of
whether the Vampire is Knocked Down or Stunned but he suffers all
penalties for standing up for example. The Vampire may change
back to Vampire form at the start of any subsequent recovery phase.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Ratswarm Form 6 3 0 3 3 * * 4 *
While in Ratswarm form the Vampire may not use weapons and
does not receive any protection from armour. He cannot shoot with a
missile weapon or cast spells but can attack in close combat without
a penalty for fighting without a weapon. The Vampire should be
represented by a Ratswarm base but treat the Vampire as being the
size of a single rat for moving through alleys or similar small
spaces. The Vampire may move through small holes and gaps that
would allow a single rat-sized creature to pass through and can thus
move through walls as most have a small holes in them.
Bat Form: Many Vampires can transform into giant bats. A
Vampire can change form in exactly the same manner as detailed
above.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Bat Form 8 3 0 3 2 * * 1 *
Whilst in Bat form the Vampire may fly and ignores movement
penalties, he cannot run as such but may move double distance and a
charge move is also doubled. The Vampire may not use weapons
and does not receive any protection from armour. He cannot shoot
with a missile weapon or cast spells but can attack in close combat
without a penalty for fighting without a weapon.
Wolf Form: Many Vampires can transform into Giant Wolves. A
Vampire can change form in exactly the same manner as described
above.

#### Wardancer Skill List

Aerial Fury: Instead of making a normal charge the Wardancer
may use the Aerial Fury skill. If the Wardancer passes an initiative
test he may jump into combat with the same effects as a diving
charge. This attack can be made from ground level and does not
have to be made from a higher position as per normal diving charge
as the Wardancer simply leap up and brings death to his foes from
above.
Blade Master: The Wardancer is a master of the dance and his skill
with his twin blades is legendary. This allows the Wardancer to use
his second blade to re-roll his parry attempt in the same way as a
buckler though still gaining a +1 attack bonus.
I Shall Fight: Who I Please - With this ability the Wardancer may
charge any enemy within range and line of sight regardless of
models intercepting. Opponent’s clumsy attempts to intercept the
Wardancer are easily dodged or even leapt over.
Ritual Trance: The Warrior puts himself into a ritual chance before
the battle begins. The warrior is utterly fearless and has an undying
lust for combat. The warrior is immune to all psychology.

#### Wood Elf Special Skills

```
Luck. The Wood Elf is blessed by Lileath, the Elven goddess of
luck. Once per game he may re-roll any dice roll he makes (but not
one made by other members of the warband).
Unerring Accuracy: The warrior is a deadly archer and is famous
for his uncanny skill to target eye-sockets or other vulnerable parts
of his enemies body. When the Wood Elf uses a bow (of any kind)
he or she causes a Critical Hit on the roll of 5+, instead of a 6 (but
not if the roll To Wound is exactly 5+, just as with a normal Critical
Hit though on 6+).
Fey protection: The flow of the forest of Athel Loren is a bit
stronger in this warrior and offer a degree of protection against the
winds of magic. The Elven warrior receives a Save of 4+ against the
effect of any magic that affects him or her.
Fey Quickness: Few mortal beings can ever hope it match an Elf ́s
quickness and agility. An Elven warrior with this skill can avoid
hand-to-hand combat or missile attacks on a roll of 6. If the warrior
also has the Step Aside or Dodge skill this will increase the special
save to 4+ in the relevant area (IE a warrior with Step Aside avoids
hand-to-hand combat attacks on 4+ and missile attacks on 6+).
Seeker: Being an expert Tracker, the Wood Elf is able to spot even
hidden treasures. He may modify the result of one exploration die by
+/- 1. Only one Wood Elf Hero may possess this skill!
Powerful Built: The warrior is strongly built for an Wood Elf, and
is capable of feats of strength not often seen among the Wood Elf. A
warrior with this skill may choose skills from the Strength skill table
from now on, in addition to his other skill tables. There may bever
be more than two Wood Elf with this skill in the warband at any one
time.
Infiltration: A Wood Elf with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12” from any enemy model. The Scout may set up hidden
if you wish. If both players have models which infiltrate, roll a D6
for each, and the lowest roll sets up first.
Asrai Archery: The Wood Elf dose not suffer -1 penalty for
moving and shooting
Sniper: Centuries of stalking the intruders of Athel Loren has taught
the Wood Elf to strike from cover without being seen. If Hidden a
Wood Elf with this skill may shoot or cast spells and still remain
Hidden.
One with the Target: The Wood Elf has trained himself to enter a
trance like state when firing a bow. If he does not move in the
movement phase he may automatically hit one target within range
with a single shot.
Set Traps: Wood Elves are expert trappers and hunters and these
skills can be put to great use in the ruins of Mordheim. A Wood Elf
may set a trap if he spends a turn doing nothing else (he may not set
traps if he’s just recovered from being Knocked Down). Place a
marker in base contact with the Wood Elf. When a model, friend or
foe, moves within 2” of the marker he risks setting of the trap – roll
a D6. On a score of 3+ he has triggered the trap and suffers a S4 hit
(note that the Wood Elf won’t trigger his own traps). If the trap did
not wound the model or it didn’t trigger, the “victim” may finish his
move otherwise he is placed Knocked Down or Stunned 2” from the
marker. Regardless whether the trap was triggered or not, the marker
is removed.
Hide in Shadow: enemy attempting to detect a Wood Elf with this
skill must halve his inniative
Hunters Eye - The Wood Elf’s keen eyesight and mastery of
the bow allow him to pinpoint weak points on opponents
body when shooting conferring a +1 mod. On injury rolls
after a successful wound caused by shooting.
```

### Starting the game

#### Pre-battle sequence

Although you can simply decide with your opponent which
scenario you want to play, most players prefer to generate
their scenarios randomly. To do this, work your way through
the following sequence before the battle.
1 The player with the lowest warband rating rolls on the
Scenario table to determine which scenario is played. In the
scenarios where there is an attacker and a defender, the same
player may choose which he is.
2 Roll for warriors with old battle wounds to see whether
they can take part or not.
3 Set up the terrain and warbands according to the rules for
the scenario you are playing. The more buildings the better,
so you should place all the terrain you have.

#### Rules for playing multiplayer games

Size of playing area: Multiplayer Mordheim obviously
requires more room to play. While Mordheim normally plays
fine in a 4'x4' area, the size of the playing area for
multiplayer games should be at least 4'x6'. This is important
for set-up as detailed below.
Attackers and defenders: In scenarios where attackers and
defenders are defined, the defender is the player whose
warband has the highest rating. If more than one warband
have the same highest rating, the defender will be the one
among them whose warband includes the most models. If
there is still a tie, roll a dice to determine who gets to be the
defender. There is only ever one defender, all the other
warbands are the attackers.
Setting up the warbands: In scenarios where there is a
defender, that player sets up his warband first. To determine
who among the attacking warbands sets up next (or among all
the warbands in a scenario without defined attackers and
defenders), each player rolls a D6. The player with the
highest roll sets up next and the remaining players set up in
order of descending dice rolls.

When it is his turn to set up his warband, each player must
choose one segment of table edge (see the diagram above for
what constitutes a ‘segment’) and set up his warband within
6" of it. No player may start a member of his warband within
6" of a member of another warband.
Note that some scenarios will have special set-up rules
(usually for the defender) which are different from the above.
Any such variation will be noted in the rules for that scenario.
Order of play: After all warbands have been set up, players
must determine the order of play. Players should be arrayed

```
about the table by their set-up segment (see above). Each
player rolls a D6. The player with the highest roll gets the
first turn. Play proceeds clockwise around the table from
there.
Underdogs: In multiplayer Mordheim, the underdog is not so
clear. Any warband can be an underdog if it is attacked by
two or more of its rivals! Still, there may be cases where one
warband is simply playing out of its league. To determine if a
warband is an underdog in multiplayer Mordheim, simply
take the warband with the lowest warband rating and
compare it to the warband with the next highest rating. Use
the difference in ratings and the chart from the Experience
section of the Mordheim rules to determine if any experience
bonus is justified for the lower warband, just as you would
for the lower of two warbands in a two player game.
Shooting into close combat: Unlike in the regular Mordheim
rules, it is possible to shoot into close combat in multiplayer
games, just as long as the shooters belong to a different
warband than the models involved in the Close Combat.
Shooters must still fire at the closest enemy model as normal
(unless they are in an elevated position, as per the normal
rules). However, if the shooter hits a model involved in a
close combat, the shot may well hit one of his opponents and
not the model itself. Randomise any missile hits between the
target and any models in close combat with him.
Close combat involving multiple warbands: In multiplayer
Mordheim it is quite possible that one warband member gets
charged by models from two or more opposing warbands.
When this occurs, a model will fight during the Close
Combat phase of each model it is fighting. This can give a
model many attacks during a cycle of player turns but any
model that has been ganged up on in this way is probably
done for in any case!
Routing warbands: Unlike normal games of Mordheim, one
warband failing its Rout test (or having all of its models
taken out of action) does not necessarily end the game.
Unless there are special victory conditions noted in the rules
for the scenario you are using, a multiplayer game will last
until there
is only one warband left on the table. The player whose
warband stays on the table for the longest is normally the
winner, though in some scenarios the winner might be the
warband leaving the table first, as it achieves its objective and
leaves the scene!
Allies: Normal games of Mordheim involve one warband
competing or fighting against another. Obviously, in this
environment alliances are not normally possible. However, in
multiplayer games, alliances are not only possible; they are a
necessity for the completion of some scenarios! A single
warband attempting to take out a dragon will find itself
fighting an uphill battle with very little chance of success,
indeed, it may well find itself lacking a few members after
failing to complete its objective! Alliances can last until the
end of the game (for example, two warbands can decide to
ally against a third, and split whatever booty exists at the
end), or they can be very temporary (often falling apart quite
suddenly and violently!)
To form an alliance, a player must declare that he is doing so
at the start of his turn. He must declare (to all players) which
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 192 Assembled by Paul H


warband(s) he wants to ally with and if they agree, the
alliance is formed. There is no limit to the number of
warbands a player can ally with. The following special rules
apply to a warband and its allies:
Members of allied warbands do not count each other as
enemies. Members of a warband may freely run within 8" of
members of any warbands they are allied to. Models forced to
charge enemy models due to some special rule (such as
Frenzy or Orc & Goblin Animosity) are not forced to charge
allies. Note however that an Orc or Goblin failing an
Animosity test counts allied models as friendly Hired Swords
so if a ‘1’ is rolled for the effects of the Animosity he will
charge or shoot at them if they are the closest friendly
models.
Members of allied warbands that are in combat with one
another when the alliance is announced will automatically
break from combat. Place the models 1" apart from each
other. They can move as normal in their next Movement
phase (so models knocked down or stunned follow the normal
rules for being knocked down or stunned, etc).
Initiating close combat with, shooting missile weapons at, or
throwing non-helpful spells at a member of an allied warband
automatically breaks the alliance with that warband. Note that
this includes attacks caused by a failed Animosity test. Your

```
allies aren’t going to be as forgiving of such behaviour as
your own warband members might be!
```
#### Creating a Scenario Table

```
To create a Scenario table, firstly each players will choose a
Scenario they wish to play then roll 2D6 for it place on the
Table (This can be used for both Two Player or Multiplayer
games) repeat this until all the spaces are filled. If the Place
Roll is already fill, then +1/-1 the result, if that does not work
then re-roll.
```
##### Scenario table

```

#### Two Player Scenarios

##### Scenario: Defend the find

Often a warband finds a building with a hoard of wyrdstone or
other treasure inside, only to be challenged by a rival warband. This
usually leads to conflict as it is unlikely that either side will be
willing to give up the wealth easily.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'. The first
building should be placed in the centre of the table, and the
objective of the scenario is to take control of this building.
Warbands
The warband with the lowest number of warriors in it is
automatically the defender. If both sides are equal, roll to
decide.
The defender is deployed first inside or within 6" of the
objective building. The attacking warband is deployed within
6" of any table edge. Note that you can split the warband to
enter from different edges if you wish.
Starting the game
The attacker has the first turn.
Ending the game
If at the end of the defender’s turn the attacker has more
standing models within 6" of the objective than the defender,
the attacker wins. Alternatively, when one of the warbands
fails its Rout test the game ends.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 extra Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
Wyrdstone
One shard of wyrdstone for each Hero of either warband who
is inside the objective building at the end of the game (up to a
maximum of three shards per warband).

##### Scenario: Skirmish

```
In the vastness of the Mordheim ruins there is always the risk of
running into a rival warband. While two groups sometimes pass
each other without a fight, more often than not there is a vicious
battle amongst the ruins. If a warband can drive their rivals away,
they will have a larger area in which to search for wyrdstone.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Warbands
Each player rolls a dice. Whoever rolls highest chooses who
sets up first. The first player then chooses which table edge to
set up on, placing all his warriors within 8" of that edge. His
opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The higher scoring player takes the
first turn.
Ending the game
When one of the warbands fails its Rout test, the game ends.
The routing warband loses and their opponents win.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 extra Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy model he puts out of action.
```

##### Scenario: Wyrdstone hunt

Scattered in the ruins of Mordheim are innumerable tiny shards of
priceless wyrdstone. It often happens that two warbands come upon
the same area and only a battle can determine who will pick the
spoils.
In this scenario, warbands encounter each other while
scavenging in the same ruined warehouse, vault, temple or
other such potentially rich building.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Special rules
Once you have placed the terrain, put some Wyrdstone
counters on the tabletop to represent where the shards are.
There will be D3+1 counters in total.
Each player takes it in turn to place a counter. Roll a D6 to
see which player goes first. The counters must be placed
more than 10" from the edge of the table and at least 6" away
from each other. Note that counters are placed before
deciding which edge the warbands will play from, so it is a
good idea to put counters towards the middle of the table.
Warriors can pick up the counters simply by moving into
contact with them. A warrior can carry any amount of
wyrdstone without any penalty. Warriors cannot transfer their
wyrdstone to another warrior. If the warrior who is carrying a
counter is taken out of action, place the counter on the table
where he fell.
Warbands
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever
rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of his
choice. His opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite
edge.
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the
first turn.
Ending the game
He game ends when one warband fails its Rout test. The
routers automatically lose.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero or Henchman is
carrying a Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle he
receives +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
Wyrdstone
Your warriors earn one shard of wyrdstone for each counter
still in their possession at the end of the battle.

##### Scenario: Breakthrough

```
When news of a huge deposit of wyrdstone starts circulating,
warbands will mount expeditions to unearth the wealth. However,
their rivals often try to block them, eager to claim all the wyrdstone
for themselves.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Warbands
Each player rolls a dice. Whoever scores higher decides
which table edge the attacker sets up on.
The attacker sets up first, within 8" of his table edge. The
defender sets up anywhere on the table as long as all his
warriors are at least 14" away from any attacker.
Starting the game
The attacker has the first turn.
Ending the game
If one of the warbands fails a Rout test, the game ends
immediately and the routing warband loses.
If the attacker manages to move two or more standing
warriors to within 2" of the defender’s table edge, they have
broken through and he wins the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle, they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Breaking Through. Any warrior earns +1 Experience for
breaking through enemy lines. If the warrior is a Henchman,
then the whole group gains +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: Street fight

Often two warbands will come face to face with each other in the
narrow streets of Mordheim. Sometimes they pass each other
without incident but more often the meeting ends in bloodshed.
Terrain
Set up all the buildings into a single street, with no gaps
along the sides. Behind the buildings are impassable ruins,
although the buildings themselves are still accessible. The
only way out is along the street. The street may be as winding
as you like and should not be too narrow to fight in, but can
have narrow bottlenecks at some points. We suggest that the
terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up
Both players roll a D6 to see who sets up first. Whoever rolls
highest chooses whether to deploy first or second. The
warbands are deployed within 6" of opposite ends of the
street.
Special rules
Neither warband can backtrack down the street to leave the
battlefield via their own edge.
Starting the game
Roll a D6 to see who has the first turn.
Ending the game
When one of the warbands manages to move all its remaining
warriors out of the street via the opposing edge, the game
ends and that player is victorious.
Alternatively a warband which fails a Rout test loses the
game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Escaping. The first Hero from either side (not both!) who
exits via the opposing table edge gains +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: Chance encounter

```
Both warbands have completed their daily search of the ruins and
are on their way back to their encampment when they run into each
other. Neither side was expecting a fight, and the warband that
reacts the quickest has the advantage.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up
```
1. Each player rolls a D6. The player with the higher score
can choose to deploy first or second.
2. The first player to deploy sets up his entire warband in one
quarter of the table. The quarter of the table which the first
warband deploy in is nominated as deployment zone A.
3. The second warband can then be set up in the opposite
quarter of the table. The quarter of the table which the second
warband deploy in is nominated as deployment zone B, but
no model may be set up within 14" of any enemy model.
    Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 and adds the normal Initiative of their
leader. The player with the higher score goes first.
    Special rules
Each warband is carrying D3 shards of wyrdstone at the
beginning of the battle. Mark down the number each warband
has.
    Ending the game
The battle ends when one warband fails a Rout test. The
routing warband loses.
    Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle then they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
    Wyrdstone
Both warbands gain all the wyrdstone they were carrying at
the beginning of the battle, minus the number of their own
Heroes that were taken out of action during the game, down
to a minimum of zero. In addition, they gain one extra shard
of wyrdstone for each enemy Hero they take out of action, up
to the maximum number of shards the opposing warband was
carrying at the beginning of the battle.


##### Scenario: Hidden treasure

There is a rumour that one of the ruined buildings has a concealed
cellar with a treasure chest hidden in it. Two rival warbands have
heard about the cellar and are now searching the area. Who knows
what they will find?
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up
Both players roll a D6 and whoever rolls highest chooses
which warband sets up first. This warband is deployed within
8" of any table edge the player chooses. His opponent sets up
within 8" of the opposite side.
Special rules
All the warriors (not animals!) in each warband know
roughly what they are looking for and must inspect the
buildings to find the treasure. Each time a warrior enters a
building which has not been previously searched by either
side roll 2D6. On a score of 12, he has found the treasure.
Buildings in the deployment zones are not searched (since
they have already been thoroughly ransacked) and each
building may only be searched once.
If you have not scored 12 with any roll when there is only
one building left to search, the treasure will automatically be
found there. After finding the treasure chest, the warrior must
then take it to safety via his own table edge. Carrying the
treasure chest will slow the warrior carrying it to half speed.
Two or more models may carry the chest without any
penalty. You may use the treasure chest model to represent
the chest. If the carrier is put out of action, place the treasure
chest at the spot where he fell. Any man-sized model may
pick it up by moving into base contact with it.
Whoever recovers the chest may roll on the following chart
after the game to see what the chest contains. Note that you
roll for each item separately, apart from the gold crowns,
which are always automatically found. For example, roll to
see if you find any wyrdstone – you need a 5+ to find it. Then
roll to see if you find the armour, and so on. This can make
the chest a very valuable acquisition – however, it could also
mean that your warband has risked death for only three gold
crowns!

```
ITEMS D6 ROLL REQUIRED
3D6 GC Automatic
D3 pieces of wyrdstone 5+
Suit of light armour 4+
Sword 3+
D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+
Starting the game
Roll a D6. The player rolling highest has the first turn.
Ending the game
When one warband gets the treasure to safety, or a warband
fails a Rout test, the game ends. The victorious warband then
gains the treasure chest.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+2 For Finding the Chest. If a Hero finds the treasure chest
he earns +2 Experience.

##### Scenario: Occupy

This scenario takes place in a part of Mordheim where the buildings
are bursting with shards of wyrdstone and other wealth. Taking and
holding these buildings means that your warband gains rich
pickings. Unfortunately, your opponent has the same idea.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Warbands
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score
decides which warband sets up first. The first player chooses
the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all his
warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within 8"
of the opposite edge.
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the higher score takes
the first turn.
Special rules
The objective is to capture D3+2 of the buildings on the
tabletop. Mark these buildings, starting with the one closest
to the centre of the table, working your way outwards to the
next nearest building. A building is occupied if at least one of
your standing models is inside and no enemy models are
inside the building.
Ending the game
There is no need to take any Rout tests – as the game lasts for
a maximum of eight turns. If one warband voluntarily routs,
the game ends and the winning warband is considered to
occupy all of the buildings on the table.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives they
gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the warband who controls
the highest number of buildings at the end of the battle gains
+1 Experience.
If both sides occupy the same number of buildings, then the
battle is considered to be a draw and neither leader gains this
bonus.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.

##### Scenario: Surprise attack

```
One warband is out searching the ruins of Mordheim for loot when
it is attacked by an enemy warband. The defenders are spread thinly
and must muster a defence quickly to drive off their attackers.
Terrain
Starting with the attacker, each player takes it in turn to place
a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or other
similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within an
area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up
```
1. The defending player rolls a D6 for each Hero and
Henchman group in his warband, in any order he chooses. On
a 1-3, they are elsewhere in the ruins and turn up later as
reinforcements. On a 4-6 they are deployed at the start of the
game.
Note that at least one Hero or Henchmen group will be
present at the start. If all roll 1-3, the last Hero or Henchmen
group will automatically be deployed at the start of the battle.
2. The defender deploys his available Heroes and Henchmen
on the table. No model may be closer than 8" to another
model, as the warband is spread out wide to search the ruins.
No model may be deployed closer than 8" to a table edge.
3. The attacker deploys his whole warband within 8" of a
random table edge, as shown below. He may choose which
edge to nominate as ‘1’ before rolling to see where he
deploys.
    Starting the game
The attacker always gets the first turn.
    Special rules
The defender, at the start of his second and subsequent turns,
may roll a D6 for each of his Henchmen groups or Heroes not
yet on the table. On a 4+ they move on in the movement
phase from a random table edge, roll a D6 (Starting at the
table edge to nominate as ‘1’ and going clockwise for edges
2, 3 & 4. On a roll of a 5 the defending player may freely
choose which edge they will deploy from, but on a roll of a 6
the attacking player may choose which edge they will deploy
from) All reinforcements for that turn arrive from the same
edge and may charge on the turn in which they arrive.
    Ending the game
The game ends when one warband fails a Rout test. The
routing warband loses.
    Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.

##### Scenario: The Rescue

By Pete Rejowski
There are times when your most experienced Heroes are slain, and
you mourn them greatly; however, it is often worse for them to be
captured by the enemy, as not only will it be likely that you cannot
get them back, but your enemy will also greatly profit from it. As the
basic number of scenarios in the Mordheim rulebook does not
include a Rescue mission, negotiations are the only way to go, and,
to put it simply, there are too many reasons for negotiations to fail
(the leader wants to sacrifice the Hero and gain experience, too
much money to pay for the equipment, the player doesn't ever want
to fight that Hero again, etc). This scenario addresses that flaw and
allows a warband to attempt to regain their lost companion.
If such a situation arises, the warband that had a Hero captured
may opt to play the next scenario as a Rescue Mission; this cannot
be superseded by anything, nor can the warband who captured the
Hero deny the Rescue Mission. But if the mission is failed, the
attacking warband cannot play another Rescue Mission immediately
after, even if the option to choose the scenario comes up in the game
after (or even if he had a different Hero captured!). A warband with
the Mordheim map that allows it to “automatically choose the next
scenario” may instead choose the scenario played after the Rescue
Mission (that is, an attempted rescue does not ruin the potential
gain of the Mordheim map for either player).
Notes: This scenario plays like a combination of Defend the
Find and Surprise Attack combined with the Rescue Mission
from Necromunda. It borrows certain elements from the
Necromunda scenario (namely the movement of the sentries,
as seen below), but plays out a bit differently due to the
altered spotting rules and the lack of loud firearms. Those
who have access to the Necromunda version can easily draw
comparisons between the two, but a few things have changed
to keep it more in line with standard Mordheim scenarios.
Terrain
Each player takes a turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. It is suggested
that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'. The
first building should be placed in the centre of the table, as
the objective of the scenario (the captured Hero and his gear)
will be placed within.
Set-up
The prisoner and his gear are set up in the central building as
described above. The prisoner may not act until he is freed.
The defender is not allowed to attack or “execute” his
prisoner, but must attempt to drive off the rescuers. Once the
captive is freed, however, he is fair game.
A prisoner is free to move and fight once cut free by a
friendly fighter. The friend moves into base contact with him
and spends the rest of the turn cutting him free; he may not
shoot, cast spells, and fight in hand-to-hand or anything else
at all. Once freed, the prisoner may move and attack
normally. Note that the captive has no weapons or other
equipment until he reclaims his own (or if the friendly fighter
gives him something).
The attacking warband can reclaim the captive's gear by
moving into base contact with the chest. As above, it takes an
entire turn to open the chest. If the model who opens the
chest later comes in contact with the prisoner, he may give
him all of his old gear; however, the prisoner may not put on
any armour, as a quick escape is desired (he may use a shield
as normal).

```
Warbands
The warband that captured the Hero is automatically the
defender, and sets up his warband as follows:
1) The defending player rolls a D6 for each Hero and
Henchman group in his warband in any order that he chooses.
On a 1-3, they are elsewhere (patrolling a wider perimeter),
and may turn up if the alarm is sounded (as detailed below).
On a 4-6 they are deployed at the start of the game. Note that
at least one Hero or Henchmen group will be present at the
start. If all roll 1-3, the last Hero or Henchmen group will
automatically be deployed at the start of the battle.
2) The defender deploys his available troops on the table. No
model may be closer than 6” to another model, as the
warband is spread out to keep a careful lookout. No model
may be deployed closer than 8” to a table edge. The defender
also places the captured model anywhere in the center
building, and also places a treasure chest (representing his
gear) in the same building. Note that the defender cannot use
any special set-up rules, such as Infiltration.
3) The attacker deploys his whole warband within 8” of a
random table edge, as shown in the diagram for the Surprise
Attack scenario. He may choose which edge to nominate as
“1” before rolling to see where he deploys. The attacker can
use special set-up rules (such as Infiltration) as normal.
However, the attacker cannot use any mounted figures in this
battle, as they are far too noisy; the mounts will be left at
their encampment.
Starting the game
The attacker always gets the first turn.
Special rules
Sentries: Until the alarm is sounded (see below), the
defender's models are moving about in a somewhat random
pattern, keeping a look out. Each sentry moves d6-3 inches
per turn; roll separately for each model. If the distance is
negative, then the attacking player is allowed to move that
model. After moving each sentry, roll the Scatter dice and
turn the model to face the direction indicated. Models with
Stupidity move like this until the alarm is sounded
(effectively ignoring their Stupidity for now).
Sounding the alarm: Until the alarm is sounded, sentries
move as described above. In addition, their Weapon Skill is
halved (rounding fractions up), and they may not shoot or
cast spells. After the alarm is sounded, the sentries may move
and attack freely. In addition, the defender may be able to
bring on reinforcements as described below. The alarm can
be sounded in a number of ways:
Spotting: Roll 2d6 at the end of the defender's turn; this, plus
an individual model's detection range (the range used to
detect Hidden models; usually their Initiative value), is the
distance at which a model can try to spot the enemy. They
must be within the front 90° arc of the model. This represents
that the swirling fog and lingering smoke that fills Mordheim
is somewhat distracting when an enemy does not clearly
present itself; as well, it shows that the attacker is attempting
to move more stealthily than normal.
Attackers in the open will be spotted on a d6 roll of 2+.
Attackers in cover will be spotted on a d6 roll of 4+.
```

Attackers out of sight of a sentry and not in their frontal arc,
but within the detection range of the sentry will be “spotted”
(more like heard) on a roll of 6.
Sentries will spot any attacker within their detection range
and their front arc on a 4+, whether the attacker is visible or
not; if such an attacker is visible at all (including if in cover),
this chance increases to a 2+.
Raiders are also spotted if they move within sight of a sentry
during their own turn. The spotting range is as rolled in the
defender's turn, and the same dice rolls are required.
Remember, sentries can only see within their frontal arc until
the alarm is sounded.
If a sentry spots a raider, he sounds the alarm. However, he
can only give the alarm if he survives the attacker's turn. If he
is taken Out of Action, then he cannot sound the alarm.
Shooting: If an attacker shoots a black powder weapon, roll
d6 and add the weapon's Strength to the score. If the result is
over 8, the alarm is sounded. Note that firing a black powder
weapon can sound the alarm even if there are no sentries left.
Fighting: A sentry who is attacked in hand-to-hand combat
will sound the alarm if he survives the turn (even if Knocked
Down or Stunned). Remember that the sentry's Weapon skill
is halved until the alarm is sounded. If the raider shoots a
black powder weapon in hand-to-hand, then you must roll as
described above to see whether the shots sound the alarm
even if the enemy is killed.
In addition, the noise of fighting may cause the alarm to be
sounded even if the sentry doesn't survive to do so himself.
The attacker rolls a d6; if the score is not more than the
number of attackers fighting in the hand-to-hand combat,
then the noise of the scuffle has been noticed and the alarm is
sounded. For example, if three attackers slaughter a single
sentry, then you must roll 4 or more on the d6 for this to go
unnoticed.

```
Reinforcements
Once the alarm has been sounded, the defender may attempt
to bring on the rest of his warband. For each Hero or
Henchmen group not on the table, roll a d6, and on a 4+, they
move on in the movement phase from a random table edge as
shown in the diagram for Surprise Attack. All reinforcements
for that turn arrive from the same edge and may charge on the
turn in which they arrive.
Ending the game
The game ends if the captive is freed and makes his escape
by moving off any table edge. The game also ends if all the
attackers are taken Out of Action. Due to the high tension and
stress of the situation, neither warband is forced to take Rout
Tests until they have lost half of their warband (instead of the
usual 25%).
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 per enemy Out of Action. A hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts Out of Action.
+1 Escapes. The captured model gains +1 Experience if he
successfully exits the board.
+1 Winning Leader (Attacker). The leader of the attacking
warband gains +1 Experience if victorious.
+2 Winning Leader (Defender). The leader of the defending
warband gains +2 Experience if victorious.
Finial Notes
Note that even if a Rescue Mission is failed, the attacker can
still attempt to negotiate for the release of his Hero. However,
given the fact that he just attacked the rival warband, this will
undoubtedly drive up the price! Of course, it is quite possible
that the attacker could have Captured one of the defender's
models, making a trade viable; also, the attacker will likely
have a bit more money to offer, as he gets a second game
worth of exploration (assuming any of his Heroes survived).
```
##### Scenario: Stake-Out

By Gavin Thorpe
While leading his men on a territory-claiming mission, the
warband’s Leader becomes the target of an assassination attempt by
a band of stealthy attackers.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up
Firstly the defender sets up his warband in his deployment
zone, His leader must be the furthest model away from any
table edge. He must be at least 12” away from any table
edge. After the defender has setup, the attacker will sets up
his warband anywhere on the table, except that a model
cannot be set-up within its charge reach of an enemy.
Starting the game
The scenario attacker goes first.
Special rules

1. The scenario defenders are taken completely by surprise.
At the start of the defenders’ first turn, each model must pass
an Initiative test or do nothing for the first turn.
2. Defending models can escape by moving off any table
edge, but they may not return.

```
Ending the Game: The game ends when one side fails its
Rout Test, the defending leader is killed or manages to escape
from the table. If the defending leader is killed, the scenario
attackers win. If he escapes, the scenario defenders win. The
winners gain +1 shard of wyrdstone.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 extra Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Target Survived. If the defender’s leader escapes he
earns +1 Experience (as well as +1 for “winning leader”).
+1 Target Stopped. Whoever puts the defender’s leader Out
of Action will earns +1 Experience (if by a Henchman then
entire group benefit).

##### Scenario: Race to the Stash

By Jace Proctor
In the aftermath of the comet's fall, Mordheim has become a
labyrinth of ruined buildings, decaying streets, abandoned
catacombs, and treacherous alleyways. Some even say that the city
itself is alive, and has the power to reorder its chaotic innards in
order to confuse or destroy the imposing warbands who plunder the
city for precious wyrdstone. It is not uncommon for a warband to
find a safe haven or a stash of treasure only to find it completely
vanished the next day, replaced by a completely different structure.
It is for this reason that warbands will often assail a place of worth
as quickly as possible, to ensure that they can plunder its riches
before it is never seen again. Sometimes two or more warbands will
hear of the same location at the same time, and in these situations a
deadly race can ensue through the streets of Mordheim, with the
victor claiming lordship over the area and defending it from any
attackers.
Through your network of informants and spies, you have learned of
a large stash of treasure deep within the city's rich quarter, which
once housed the affluent and often corrupt upper class of citizens.
According to your informant, this find has only just been discovered,
and the riches are ripe for the taking! Finds like this are rare, but a
find in the rich quarter is almost unheard of, as this area of the city
is trafficked often by the warbands seeking wyrdstone and riches.
Immediately gathering your warriors and gear, you quickly embark
towards the location of the rumoured find. As you quietly make your
way across the remaining bridge and through the streets of
Mordheim, you catch sight of an opposing warband who is
travelling in the same direction as you. A row of ruined, but still
standing buildings separate you from your rivals, who have also
spotted you. The both of you quicken your pace, and suddenly you
hear the crack of a crossbow bolt whizzing through the air and
striking a wall behind you. Your warband returns fire in kind, still
racing through the mottled, uneven streets of the former rich
quarter. Through the gaps in the buildings you exchange shots,
speeding through the twists and turns of the city, approaching the
stash of treasure at breakneck speed. Whoever is to reach the horde
first will have a marked advantage, as they will be able to take
covered positions and defend the find against the attackers.
This Scenario can be used for both Two Player and
Multiplayer Games.
Terrain
Set up the terrain so that there are two lanes or streets, one for
each warband, with both lanes eventually leading to a
building or other structure that represents the treasure horde.
The lanes should be segregated by a row of buildings or other
such terrain that is impassable on foot, but can be shot
through. These lanes should be as similar as possible with
respect to length and distance from the goal, but do not have
to be perfectly straight or symmetrical. A slightly longer table
or playing area than normal is recommended for this
scenario; something roughly 5' x 2' or larger would do nicely.
Set-up
Roll a D6 for each player. The player with the highest score
can choose which lane he or she wants to set up in. The
opposing player must set up in the other lane. All models
must be deployed within 6” of the closest table edge and
inside the lanes. Because the warbands are racing toward the
goal as fast as possible, no models may be deployed on high
ground at the start of the game.

```
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 and adds the normal Initiative value of
their leader. The player with the highest total result goes first.
Special rules
Breakneck Speed: The warbands in this scenario are
navigating their way through the city as fast as possible, and
will not stop until they can see the horde of treasure they are
searching for. All models in this scenario must run the
maximum distance allowed every turn until they are within
line of sight of the goal, at which point they will slow down.
However the warbands are aware of their competition, and
will occasionally shoot toward each other in a desperate
attempt to slow the other band down. Because of this, models
armed with a shooting weapon may shoot while running, with
a -1 “to hit” penalty conferred for doing so. This penalty is
added to any other penalties as normal, such as over half
distance or being behind cover. This penalty will also replace
any “move or shoot” rules that a weapon would normally be
subject to: for example, a model armed with a handgun may
shoot his handgun while moving during this scenario, but will
suffer a -1 to hit for doing so. Reloading rules apply as
normal.
If a model moving at breakneck speed is brought into base-to
-base contact with another model, the model will not count as
charging for purposes of striking first, or gain +1 attack; the
combat will be played out normally using initiative value.
This is to represent the model's reckless speed, which is not
the same as a well-planned charge into combat, which would
allow them to strike first and gain +1 attack.
Models are considered to be moving at breakneck speed only
while they are approaching the goal. Once they have line of
sight to the goal they will not be compelled to move as
quickly or fire as recklessly, and as such the rules for
movement, shooting, etc. will return to normal on their next
turn.
Ending the game
The battle ends when one warband fails a Rout test.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Race Winners. All heroes in the warband that reaches the
stash of treasure first gain +1 Experience
```

Rewards
The winning warband may plunder the treasure horde after
the battle, keeping anything it finds. Roll a D6 for each item
on the following table, with the exception of the gold crowns,
which the warband always finds.
D6 Result
1 4D6 + 10 gold crowns.
2 A plain brown chest containing D3 helmets.
3 A small, unmarked, black chest containing D3 vials of poison.
You may choose whichever poison you wish, and may choose
more than one type of poison. Each vial is enough for one
application.
4 A worn, well-traveled wooden shipping crate filled with
weapons from far off lands. Roll a D3. On a roll of 1, you
have found a dwarf axe. On a roll of 2, you have found a
Hochland long rifle. On a roll of 3, you have found an elf bow.
Note that you may need the weapons training skill to use these
weapons, but you may sell them for the normal price (half
their retail value).
5 A gallantly decorated military crate, locked and branded with
the royal seal of Bretonnia. Inside you find a knight's lance,
and on a roll of 5+, a suit of gromril armor.
6 An ornately carved and decorated armoire, inside which hangs
a randomly generated magical artifact. Roll on the magical
artefact's table, re-rolling for any artifacts that have already
been discovered during this campaign.

##### Scenario: Camp Assault

By Ben Brissenden
After a successful day's hunting, one Warband returns to their camp
on the outside of Mordheim to revel in the spoils of their victories -
and drink themselves senseless. However, another, less-successful
Warband has followed them, and when the moon is hidden and the
fires dying, they make their move to distribute the wealth more
equally...
Terrain
The set-up should consist of a few ruined buildings
representing the outskirts of Mordheim. The camp, consisting
of perhaps more ruins, tents and importantly 2-3 campfires,
should be set up around 24" away from the ruins. The ground
between Mordheim and the camp should be littered with
ample cover, such as broken carts, rubble, and long-dead
trees.
Warbands
Each player rolls a dice. The highest scorer can choose
between being the attackers or the – I'll call them defenders,
since 'Campers' doesn't quite seem right. The defenders must
split their Warband into two halves.
Special rules
Half of the Warband, including the leader, sit round the fires
in the camp eating/drinking/kicking the gobbos/re-animating
the zombies/whatever it is your Warband does in its free
time. Importantly, there are 6 Wyrdstone counters in
possession of the attackers. Each counter must be assigned to
a model, who is carrying it. If there are not enough models to
carry the counters, then spare Wyrdstone is left by the
campfires, and can be collected by anyone when the alarm is
raised. The other half are stationed as guards (who got the
short straw!) around the camp, at least 8" away from their
drunken companions, and at least 5" away from another
guard. At the start of the game, only the guards in the
defender's Warband can move, and cannot stray more than
10" from the campfires. As soon as one of the attackers
moves within 8" of a guard, make an initiative test for the

```
guard. If passed, he spots the attackers, shouting a warning
and rousing his comrades – the rest of the defenders can now
act. If failed, he simply shakes his head, probably thinking
something along the lines of, “I knew I shouldn't have drunk
the wine when eating that cheese”, and must test again next
turn (providing the attacker is still within 8").
The attackers are aiming to steal as many shards of
Wyrdstone as possible! Each time an attacker takes a
defender out of action who is carrying a Wyrdstone counter,
the attacker collects the counter. However, the attacker must
then get to the outskirts of Mordheim (where a hidden
chest/helper is waiting). There s/he will deposit the
Wyrdstone, and can head back into the fray!
Starting the game
The attackers have the first turn.
Ending the game
The game ends when either:
a) The attackers have been routed.
b) The attackers have stolen at least 4 Wyrdstone shards and
got them back to the outskirts of Mordheim.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero or Henchman is
carrying a Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle he
receives +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: Happy Harpy Hunting Grounds

By Chris
The ruined buildings of Mordheim are home to many strange and
fantastical creatures, a number of which are the subjects of rumours
about hidden riches. Occasionally warbands will attempt to
discover whether these rumours are true. Most of the time these
adventurers are never seen again, but often enough they return
laden with treasures; often enough, that is, to convince the rest that
it’s worth a try...
A group of three Harpies have nested in one of the tall buildings in
the edge of the ruined city, and their scavenging and attacks on
unfortunate warbands has ensured a sizeable stash of valuables. In
fact, the Harpies have been nesting on some rather sizeable shards
of wyrdstone closely resembling eggs of a sort. Partially due to their
maternal instinct and probably due to the corrupting influence of the
wyrdstone the Harpies have grown extremely protective of their nest
and will guard it to the death if need be.
Terrain
Start by set one of the taller building (6" or taller) in the
centre of the playing area (The top of this is where the
Harpies have built their nest), then each player takes it in turn
to place a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or
other similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within
an area roughly 4' x 4'. Ladders may be placed in nearby
buildings, but none in the building occupied by the Harpies.
Set-up
The scenario is for two warbands and a third player whom
would control the three Harpies.
Special rules
Will not rout: The Harpies have mistaken the wyrdstone in
their nest for Harpy eggs and will fight to the death to protect
them.
Warbands
Each player rolls a dice. Whoever rolls highest chooses who
sets up first. The first player then chooses which table edge to
set up on, placing all his warriors within 8" of that edge. His
opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge. If more
warbands are used then uses the Players use the normal
warband setup rules (see ‘Setting up the warbands’) also the
amount of harpies will increase by D3 per warband.
Starting the game
The Harpies go first before any of the warbands.
Ending the game
A warband wins if all three Harpies have been taken out of
action and the other warband has routed, or the Harpies win if
both of the warbands rout before the Harpies have all been
taken out of action.

```
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband(s)
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
Wyrdstone
Roll a D3 to determine how many wyrdstone shards are
included. The nest is also full of various items. The winning
warband may roll on the chart provided to determine what is
contained in the nest.
Harpy Nest Contents
Besides the wyrdstone the following items may be in the
Harpy nest. Roll 1D6 per line. On the number shown, or
better, the item is present.
D6 Item
5+ 2D6gc
3+ Jewelled dagger
5+ Heavy armour
6+ Ithilmir sword
3+ Gems worth 30gc
6+ Wolf cloak
5+ Straggler*
3+ Lucky charm
4+ D3 shields
5+ D3 helmets
6+ D3 swords
* Somehow this unfortunate sod was whisked away to the
Harpy nest. What they had planned for him is unknown, but
he may aid you in your Exploration phase either this game or
next (see pg 217).

#### Multiplayer Scenarios

##### Scenario: Treasure hunt

By Michael Havener
Often, multiple warbands will hear the same rumour about a
wyrdstone deposit and decide to explore that section of the city at
the same time. A battle often results with the winners taking the
lion’s share of the shards home with them.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turns to place a piece of terrain, either
a ruined building, tower or other similar item. We suggest
that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'.
Special rules
Once you have placed the terrain, place D3 Wyrdstone shards
for each warband involved in the game on the tabletop to
represent where the shards are. Each player takes it in turn to
place a Wyrdstone counter. Each player rolls a D6 to
determine who places first, second, third, etc. The counters
must be placed more than 10" away from the edge of the
table and at least 6" away from each other. Note that counters
are placed before deciding which edge the warbands will play
from. Warriors can pick up the counters simply by moving
into contact with them. A warrior can carry any amount of
wyrdstone without any penalty. Warriors cannot transfer their
wyrdstone to another warrior. If the warrior who is carrying a
counter is taken out of action, place the counter back on the
table where he fell.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Players each roll a D6 to determine who goes first. Play
proceeds clockwise around the table from there (based on
where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their
Rout test. The routers automatically lose. If two or more
warbands have allied, they may choose to share the victory
and end the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband(s)
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero or Henchman is
carrying a Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle, he
receives +1 Experience.
Wyrdstone
Your warriors earn one shard of wyrdstone for each counter
in their possession at the end of the battle.

##### Scenario: Street brawl

```
By Michael Havener
Turf wars are a common sight in the ruins of Mordheim. When
multiple warbands compete for the same area, a chaotic all-out
brawl can ensue, where alliances are quickly made and broken and
bleeding bodies litter the street. Whichever warbands win the day
will have a larger area to search for the precious wyrdstone.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband setup rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling the highest has the
first turn and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their
Rout test. The routers automatically lose. If two or more
warbands have allied, they may choose to share the victory
and end the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.

##### Scenario: The Lost Prince

By Michael Havener
Travelling entertainers often tell tales of the ruined city and because
of this, sons of the privileged classes often see the city of Mordheim
as one big romantic adventure. Sometimes one will run away from
home to join a mercenary warband and make a name for himself.
Often these individuals are killed before they even get to the city but
once in a while one will get lucky and actually make it that far.
Sometimes their families are happy to see the young fool go but once
in a while, a rich merchant or noble will actually pay to have his
son saved from his inevitable fate in Mordheim.
The warbands have heard rumours that a powerful man’s son has
wandered into the ruins and a handsome reward will be paid for his
return.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'.
Special rules
The merchant’s son is initially placed in the centre of the
board. He will wander D6" in a random direction at the start
of each of the first player’s turns, until someone ‘rescues’
him. If a warband member comes into contact with the
merchant’s son (through normal movement, NOT through
charging – this is an exception to the normal rules and
represents that the merchant’s son is not the enemy and
should not be engaged in combat), the boy will attach himself
to that member and follow him around. If the ‘rescuer’ is
taken out of action, flees or routs, the merchant’s son will
attach himself to the next warband member to contact him.
Should someone wish to attack the merchant’s son, he has the
same stats as a Youngblood (see the Mercenary warband in
the Mordheim rulebook) and is armed with a sword and
dagger. If he is killed, no reward will be issued to the
winning warband, of course.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling highest has the first
turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the table
(based on where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when one warband manages to get the
merchant’s son off the table. That warband (and any allied
warband) is the winner.

##### Scenario: The Pool

By Michael Havener
Rumours abound about a pool in the city whose waters have
magical powers of healing. The warband’s patrons believe the
magical properties of the water are due to a large deposit of
wyrdstone within the pool. The warbands have been sent to collect
as much wyrdstone from the pool as they can.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'. The first
piece of terrain should be a pool of water roughly 6" in
diameter. The objective of the scenario is to gather all the
wyrdstone from the pool.
Special Rules
Roll a D3+3 to find out how many pieces of wyrdstone are in
the pool. The pool is shallow and may be entered. Any Hero
spending an entire turn within 1" of the pool doing nothing
else but searching for wyrdstone may roll at the end of his
turn to see if he finds some. On a D6 roll of 1-2, that player
has found one of the pieces in the pool. No Hero may search
within 1" of another model (friendly or enemy), as models
that are too close together disturb the waters for each other,
so that neither may see the bottom. Only as many pieces of
wyrdstone may be found as were rolled at the beginning of
the game, any searching after that is useless. A Hero can
carry any amount of wyrdstone without any penalty. Heroes
cannot transfer their wyrdstone to another warrior. If the
Hero who is carrying a counter is taken out of action, place
the counter on the table again where he fell. Another warrior
can then pick up these counters simply by moving into
contact with them.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’, above).
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling highest has the first
turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the table
(based on where players placed their warbands) from there.
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their
Rout test. The routers automatically lose. If one of more
warbands have allied, they may choose to share the victory
and end the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero or Henchman is
carrying a Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle he
receives +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: Ambush!

```
By Michael Havener
The defending warband has recently discovered a rich deposit of
wyrdstone. Unfortunately, word has leaked out about their find and
warbands throughout the city are hunting them, determined to take
the treasure for themselves.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'.
Special rules
One player is the defender, determined as normal (see
‘Attackers and defenders’ at the beginning of the article).
Each of the defending warband’s Heroes carries D3 pieces of
wyrdstone. If a Hero carrying wyrdstone is taken out of
action, place a number of counters, equal to the amount of
wyrdstone he was carrying, on the ground where he fell. Any
Hero moving into contact with them may pick up these
wyrdstone shards.
Warbands
All the models in the defending warband must be set up
within 6" of the centre of the board. The attacking warbands
are then set up as normal.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling highest has the first
turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the table
(based on where players placed their warbands) from there.
Ending the game
Do not roll for Rout tests during this game. Instead, the game
will last 10 turns or until all the wyrdstone shards have been
carried off the board, whichever comes first. The warband
that gets the most wyrdstone shards off the table (or held by
one of its Heroes when the game ends) is considered the
winner.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero is carrying a
Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle he receives +1
Experience.

##### Scenario: Monster Hunt

By Michael Havener
The warbands have heard rumours that a terrible monster has come
up out of its lair beneath the city following the recent devastation
and established a new home in the ruins. You have heard stories of
such creatures and the treasure they accumulate is the stuff of
legends. You have decided to see for yourself if the rumours are
true.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'. The first
building should be rather large (at least 6" x 6") and open
topped, preferably ruins. This building should be placed in
the centre of the table, and this is where the monster’s new
lair is located.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Special rules
The monster’s lair is located in the central building and this is
where the beast will be. The monster is young for one of its
kind and its profile reflects this. In addition, a lifetime of
living in caverns beneath the city has kept the creature from
learning to use its wings. Therefore, unlike most monsters,
this beast cannot fly. The monster will not leave its lair for
any reason, though it will use its breath weapon against any
model in range that it can see and will, of course, attack any
model entering its lair. It will charge all models entering its
lair if possible. Its ‘turn’ is performed before whichever
player won the dice roll to go first, though it will do nothing
until someone comes near its lair. For the monster’s stats, see
‘Great beasts in Mordheim’ over the page.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling the highest has the
first turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
When one warband (or more than one, if the players have
agreed to share the monster’s hoard) is the only one to have
any models within 6" of the monster’s lair, and the monster
has been put out of action, that warband is victorious and gets
the monster’s hoard. If two or more players have decided to
share the hoard, they must decide how to split it up. If they
cannot determine this peacefully, their warbands will have to
decide it un-peacefully!
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.

```
Treasure hoard
The young monster has moved its treasure hoard with it to its
new lair. Because of its age, the young monster has not
collected as much treasure as an older creature of its type.
Still, it has amassed a respectable amount. Whichever
warband has control of the monster’s lair at the end of the
game may search it to see what it contains. Note that you roll
for each item separately, apart from gold crowns, which are
always found.
Item D6 Result Needed
5D6 GC Automatic
Magical artefact (roll on artefact table) 6+
D3+1 pieces of wyrdstone 4+
Gromril axe 5+
Suit of heavy armour 5+
Suit of light armour 4+
Suit of light armour 4+
Shield 4+

D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+
Jewellery worth 10-60 GC 5+
Great beasts in Mordheim
Regular games of Mordheim are not really suitable for the
introduction of the larger monsters that roam the Warhammer
world. Even a small dragon, for example, would eat the
average Mordheim warband for lunch! Due to the nature of
multiplayer Mordheim, however, with its alliances and
generally broader emphasis, such creatures may well make an
appearance without overly upsetting the game. Monsters in
Mordheim are a bit smaller than their Warhammer
counterparts – they represent creatures that have lurked
underground in the caverns beneath the city, are former
denizens of Mordheim’s world famous Imperial zoo, or are
young members of their species who have recently been
forced out of the nest and have decided to set up a new lair in
the ruined city. If a monster is desired, the players should
either choose what type of Monster they are hunting from the
Beasts, Monsters & Townsfolk section of the Rulebook.

##### Scenario: The Writing on the Wall

By James Burkhouse
The warbands have each heard rumours of a map drawn on an alley
wall on Tyler Street that leads to great treasure! This alley is in the
Poor Quarter, a cluttered and twisting section of the city. Whoever
can decipher the map and keep this precious knowledge from their
enemies will gain a great advantage in the hunt for a fantastic
treasure!
TERRAIN
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. If your terrain
collection allows, a dense warren of narrow, crooked streets
is ideal. In any case, the centre of the table should have two
buildings, placed close together so as to form an alley, one
inch wide. The map will be written in this alley. Because of
the ruins, close confines of the alley, trash, etc., the alley is
considered difficult terrain. We suggest the terrain is set up in
an area roughly 4' x 4'.
WARBANDS
The warband with the lower warband rating chooses whether
to set up first or last. The first player then chooses which
table edge to set up on, and places all of his warriors within
8” of that edge. His opponent then sets up within 8” of the
opposite edge. Because of the dense, mazelike construction
surrounding Tyler Street, skills or abilities which allow
special deployment may not be used.
SPECIAL RULES
The map on the alley wall was written by a madman, and the
warriors in Mordheim will have a tough time puzzling it out
in the middle of a fight! In order to understand the map, a
hero must be moved into the middle of the alley, and must
spend two full turns doing nothing but studying the writing.
Heroes who have taken at least one Academic skill may
decipher the writing in one turn rather than two.
Once a warband has no further use for the map, they may ruin
the wall so other warbands can't follow the directions to the
treasure! The wall has 1 Wound, and a Toughness of 7.
Attacks against the wall automatically hit, and any wound
ruins the map. Anyone attacking the wall must be in the alley
(they cannot ruin the map from the other side of the wall).
The map doesn't lead to a specific treasure; rather it marks
out good routes through the Poor Quarter. Warbands who
have deciphered the map may add one of a kind in the next
exploration phase, after rolling the dice. For example a player
who rolled 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, and 6 could choose to add another 3
in order to find Prisoners (the result for a triple 3) rather than
a corpse (the result for a double 3). Alternatively, the player
could opt for an extra 5 or 6 in order to find something else
entirely. This addition does not affect how many Wyrdstone
shards the warband recovers.

```
STARTING THE GAME
The player with the lower warband rating has first turn.
ENDING THE GAME
If one warband is able to decipher the writing on the wall,
and then ruin said writing, the scenario ends immediately,
and that warband wins.
If both warbands manage to decipher the writing, then the
scenario ends in a draw. If one warband deciphers the writing
and then routs, the game ends in a draw. If the writing is
somehow ruined before it can be deciphered by either
warband, the scenario ends in a draw.
Alternatively, if one side routs, the other wins. The winners
are assumed to decipher and orient the writing at their leisure.
EXPERIENCE
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for any enemy he puts out of action.
+1 for Deciphering the Writing. Any Hero who deciphers
the writing during the battle (limit 1 per warband) gains +1
Experience.
+1 for Ruining the Writing. Any Hero who ruins the
writing (after it has been deciphered!) earns +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: Spawn Hunting

By Thrasher Kitch
"Over there men! After it! 50 Crowns to the man who brings
that chaos beast down!" shouted Captain Alkazar to his men, as
they chased the twisted Chaos Spawn through the ruined streets
of what was once a productive farming village. In the time after
the comet fell, the streets of Mordheim were tainted by the touch
of the foul gods, and the effects visible in many areas. Men and
women bore twisted visages of their former selves, and much,
much worse was to be found. The touch of Chaos was laid
heavily on the land. Many priests of the righteous gods were
trying to do what they could, but some of the more physical
threats required a less spiritual touch, and more of a physical
beating.
In this case, a Chaos Spawn has been tracked down, and is
terrorizing its way through the remains of the city, and your
warband is chasing it, and trying to bring it down. Or maybe you're
trying to subdue it and bring it under your control, and then use it to
make it your loyal servant. Such a creature would be very, very
powerful to have under your control. However, you've run into a
snag.
Another warband has spotted you, and is closing in to intercept you
and stop the spawn themselves. What is their motive? Why are they
here? Such questions are not to be answered here.
Set Up
The setup is for two or more warbands. The warband with a
highest rating should be set up within 10" of one corner of the
board, as they are the warband hunting the spawn. Place the
spawn 16" from them, directly between them and the centre
of the board (always place it on ground level.) Place opposing
bands on the table edges opposing that player, and within 6"
of the edge. The player may pick which of the two sides he
starts on.
Note: If the warbands taking part in this campaign are highly
rated, you may be better off using multiple spawns instead of
one. So once you hit around 250, try 2, or at 375-400 try 3.
Etc. Alternatively, for multiple warbands, you could also do
it as “Number of Warbands -1” to determine how many
spawn you need.
Terrain
This scenario can take place in any locale. This could easily
be happening in the country side for Empire in Flames, or in
the ruined streets of Mordheim.
Starting the Game
The Spawn gets the first turn, and immediately make a move,
away from the band pursuing them. Then the hunting band
goes second, and roll a D6 for all other warbands taking place
in this scenario, with the highest going first.
This means the Spawn have their own turn, in addition to the
players, so here's the rundown of turn order:
Turn 1: Spawn
Turn 2: Pursuing Band (Highest Rated)
Turn 3-?: The remaining warbands, dice off for turn order.

```
Special Rules
Wyrdstone Necklace: Make note of which warrior(s) deliver
the killing blow to each of the spawn on the table. After the
fight, roll a D6 for each warrior who took a spawn OOA.
Whichever rolls the highest, he found a mysterious
Wyrdstone pendant around the neck of the spawn. He can
either wear it or sell the pendant to a wandering wizard for
10D6 GC. Should the warrior choose to put it on, consult the
following table for the result. (If the warrior in question is a
henchman, remove him from his existing group and place
him in his own group, which may never be added to again.).
Roll D6 after the game
1 The green stone drains the warrior of his vitality. Roll on
the henchman advance table, for rolls of 1-9 reduce the stat
indicated by 1 and for rolls of 10-12 the warrior mutates. All
bands except chaos bands kill a mutating warrior as they start
to change, chaos bands (possessed, carnival of chaos,
beastmen and skaven) may roll a random mutation.
2 No effect beyond dark and troubled dreams.
3-6 Roll on the henchman advance table, for rolls of 1-9
increase the stat indicated by 1 and for rolls of 10-12 the
player may choose any stat to increase by 1. The stone is not
powerful enough to increase a stat above a racial maximum,
if this is indicated roll again.
Ending the Game
The game ends only after the Spawn have been taken OOA
and only a single band is remaining on the table. Warbands
may voluntarily rout, following the normal instructions for
such in the Mordheim rulebook.
Experience
+1 Survival: Any Hero or Henchman group which survives
the battle gains +1 experience.
+1 Winning Leader: The Leader (or acting leader) of the
band gains +1 experience for winning the scenario.
+1 per Enemy out of action: A hero earns an additional +1
experience for each enemy they put out of action.
+1 Spawn Wound: A Hero or Henchmen group earns an
additional +1 experience for each wound they do to one of
the Spawn. (A henchman group may not gain more than +1
experience in this way.)

##### Scenario: The West Gatehouse

By Andy Tabor
There are many a vile warband that resides at Cut Throat's Den.
Cut Throat's Den is known to house unscrupulous warbands who
are some of the foulest scum to visit Mordheim. Warbands such as
the Righteous Sisters, Witch Hunters and other do-gooders would
shun such a decadent area.
The main path from Cut Throat's Den to The City of the Damned is
by the West Gatehouse. Normally, most would think nothing of
going to Mordheim via the West Gatehouse but danger lurks at
every corner of Mordheim and this area is not different. The West
Gatehouse remains guarded by a dark and sinister tree beast, and to
enter the city from this direction adventurer must first brave passing
by this monstrosity. Skeletons hang from its branches and who
knows how many skulls are entwined within its blackened roots.
Warbands tend to scale the walls or have found tunnels into the city
from the West side in order to avoid The Giant Oak that lurks at the
West Gatehouse.
The Great Oak that once stood near the ornate gates of the garden
uprooted itself and began a rampage of death and destruction. A
huge one hundred foot tall monster, it smashed through the
perimeter wall of the gardens and began to make its way to the West
Gatehouse where crowds had gathered in a desperate attempt to flee
the disaster.
With evil eyes glowing red, the instrument of the Shadowlord
stomped through the crowd sending broken bodies hurtling through
the air as its huge branches lashed out at the throng. Few managed
to escape the Northwester Quarter of the city during the disaster, as
the monster had rooted itself at the gateway slaughtering all that
dared to pass.
Many warbands have disappeared when they have ventured through
the West Gatehouse. There are rumours The Giant Tree guards not
only the West Gatehouse but treasure. The treasure horde has been
rumoured to include wyrdstone, jewels, armour, weapons, precious
and rare items.
Many warbands have decided to go after the Giant Tree together to
split the riches but many have died by the hands of The Great Oak
or my each other as truces only last as long as a warband wants.
Terrain
This is another great opportunity to use your Warhammer
Fortress set to use as a gatehouse and a surrounding wall
section. There should be terrain but not too much to block the
movement of The Great Oak. Each player takes it in turn to
place a piece of terrain, a ruined building, tower, wall, or
similar piece of terrain. We suggest the terrain is set up
within an area of 4' x 4' or 4' x 6' if you want to use more
warbands or just like more space. Leave a 6” x 6” square in
the middle of the board for the Great Oak.
Set-up
Players use normal warband set-up rules (see 'Setting up the
warbands').
Special rules
The Giant Oak will be placed in the middle of the board.
Each warband will roll a D3 for the amount of Dark Dryad
that will be placed on the board. The Dark Dryad will be
placed on the board before players roll for sides and will be
placed 8 inches within the Giant Oak. The Giant Oak and
Dark Dryad will always be the last “player” go move or take
its turn.
The profiles of the Giant Oak and Dark Dryad can be found
in the Beasts, Monsters & Townsfolk section of the
Rulebook.

```
Warbands
Players use normal warband set-up rules (see 'Setting up the
warbands').
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 after the terrain has been placed. The
player rolling the highest roll has the first turn, and order
proceed clockwise around the table (based on where players
placed their warbands). The Giant Oak and evil arbours will
be considered the last warband in order of play. I would
suggest that players take turns playing the Evil arbours.
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one has failed their
Rout Test. If two or more warbands are left they may ally
together to end the game but they must agree on how to split
the hoard (if Great Oak and minions are OOA). If an
agreement cannot be worked out then they will fight it out
until a “gentlemen's” agreement is reached.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle, they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earn +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 For wounding the Shadow Dryad. Any Hero or
Henchman earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on
the Shadow Dryad.
+1 For wounding the Giant Oak. Any Hero or Henchman
earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Giant
Oak.
+2 For taking the Giant Oak out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Giant Oak out of action gets a bonus
+2 experience.

##### Scenario: The Raven Barracks

By Andy Tabor
The Raven Barracks, located North West side of Mordheim, housed
the military arm of Count Steinhardht. The Empire was deeply
embroiled in a bitter civil war. During this turmoil, Count
Steinhardt refused to commit his forces to any of the three warring
factions. The Count had the finest uniforms made for his soldiers. As
the Empire went to war, expending valuable resources on arms and
soldiers Mordheim grew rich in selling arms and supplies at
extortionate prices to any side. The weapons were for top quality
and craftsmanship.
After the great disaster the barracks are empty of soldiers. The
soldiers have perished or left the city as fast as they could. Now
many warbands are attempting to get to the Raven Barracks to stock
up on supplies for themselves or to sell them at a profit. The City of
the Damned is a dark and deadly place. The route to the barracks is
dangerous and leaving alive from the barracks might be more
difficult than the warbands think.
(Ideas taken from Town Cryer 23/25: Space McQuirk, Nick
Jakos, and Mark Havener)
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, wall, or similar piece of terrain. We
suggest the terrain is set up within an area of 4' x 4' or 4' x 6'.
This is a great opportunity to use your Warhammer Fantasy
Fortress as the Raven Barracks. The barracks should be an
area that is at least 2' x 2' in the middle of the board. Plenty of
terrain should be around the barracks to provide cover and
some obstacles to get there.
Special rules
Once you have placed the terrain, place D3 +1 crate for each
warband involved in the game on the tabletop to represent
where the crates are. The crates should be 10” inches away
from the table edge and 6” inches away from each other.
Once a model is in base contact with a crate they must wait
till the next turn to move with it. No warband may use
catacombs or other like skills as information provided only
gave a vague area of the barracks.
When a model First touches a crate roll a D6. If the result is a
1 then a trap has been activated. D3 Arrows are fired at that
model at Strength 3. Only one trap per crate.
There are many options of supplies to have in the crates. Feel
free to change them to your gaming groups needs.
Supplies The supplies are in crates. Each crate can be carried
by a single model at normal movement rate (no running
allowed). Two models may carry a crate, in which case they
may run. While carrying a crate, the model may not fire any
missile weapons or use any spells. If attacked, the crate will
be dropped, ready to be carried by anyone coming into
contact with it. Once a model escapes off the board with the
crate, the model and crate cannot return to the board. Each
crate in the possession of a warband at the end of the game
earns them a roll on the Crate table.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).

```
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 after the terrain has been placed. The
player rolling the highest roll has the first turn, and order
proceed clockwise around the table (based on where players
placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when one warband manages to get all his men
off his table edge with supplies or when all but one warband
have routed. If one or more warbands have allied, they may
choose to share the victory and end the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle, they gain +1 Experience.

gains +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: The Wizard’s Mansion

By Michael Havener
Not all of the ruined buildings in the city are ordinary houses. Some
notable structures were the abodes of important town leaders or
rich merchants. Tales are told of hidden rooms filled with treasure
in such homes. The warbands have discovered the location of one
such building. Rumours abound that the former owner also dabbled
in the arcane arts, which may explain why his home was almost
untouched by the devastation.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4" x 6". The first
building should be placed in the centre of the table, and the
objective of the scenario is to take control of this building.
Warbands
One player is the defender, determined as normal (see
‘Attackers and defenders’ at the beginning of the article),
representing the warband that reached the mansion first. The
defender is deployed first inside or within 6" of the objective
building. Then the attacking warbands are set up as normal.
In addition, for each attacking warband beyond the first, the
defender rolls once on the table below to determine the
additional equipment his warband gets to start with. Each
item may only be found once. If the same number is rolled
more than once, re-roll. These items represent the findings of
the warband thus far and are meant to give the warband a
chance against multiple opponents.
D6 Item Found
1 Wooden Man
2 D3 doses of Mandrake Root
3 D3 doses of Crimson Shade
4 Lucky Charm
5 Holy (Unholy) Relic
6 Cathayan Silk Cloak
All of the above are described in the Mordheim rules except
for the Wooden Man. For rules on the Wooden Man, see new
items opposite.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling the highest has the
first turn and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their
Rout test. The routers automatically lose. If one of more
warbands have allied, they may choose to share the victory
and end the game.

```
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
The Wizard’s Treasure
At the end of the game the winning warband finds all of the
items on the table above which were not found before the
battle. In addition, roll on the following chart to see what
additional items the warband finds in the mansion. Note that
you’ll roll for each item separately, apart from gold crowns,
which are always found. For example, you will need to roll a
4+ to find a Tome of Magic. Then roll to see if you find the
Gromril Sword and so on.
D6 Roll Needed
3D6 GC Automatic
D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+
Tome of magic 4+
Gromril sword 5+
Athame 4+
D3 doses of healing herbs 4+
Dispel scroll 5+
New items
Wooden Man: Use the stats and special rules for a zombie
with +1S and +1T. The Wooden Man is an artificial construct
in the shape of a man but made of wood. It will follow the
commands of the defending warband but will not leave the
wizard’s mansion for any reason, even after the game. The
Wooden Man may obviously not be traded.
Athame: An Athame is a special silver dagger used in
magical rituals. If used in combat, it will not hold its edge.
For the first attack in a game, it will count as a normal
dagger. However, for the rest of the game it will count as a
fist attack. The Athame is worth 10 gold crowns if traded.

##### Scenario: The Gaol

By Nick Kyme and Andy Hall
The battle in the Gaol grounds is a Skirmish. Both Warbands have
happened upon the area at the same time and are fighting it out for
control, so they can loot it. Little do they realise the presence of the
dreaded ‘Warden’...
Terrain
Choose any one neutral table edge of a 4'x4' area and place a
large ruined building on the chosen table edge just on the
table. This represents a part of the Gaol. The rest of the
gaming area represents the Gaol grounds and terrain should
be set up in a mutually agreeable manner.
Set-up
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score
decides which warband sets up first. In the case of a tie, the
warband with the lowest rating decides. The first player
chooses the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all of
his warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within
8" of the opposite edge. Players cannot choose the table edge
that has the Gaol building on or the edge opposite the Gaol.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score
takes the first turn. The Warden and the Inmates (see below)
take a turn after both players have had their turn and are
effectively a third player ie, after the last player has finished
his turn, the Warden and the Inmates get their first turn. Play
then continues as normal.

```
Special rules
The Warden and his Lackeys: Hidden within the dark
recesses of the Gaol is a thing known by local scavengers and
warbands as ‘The Warden’. No one knows what it once was;
some say it was a large guard dog, others that it is a bonded
and mutated group of prison guards. Whatever its true
origins, the Warden now wanders the ruins of the Gaol
feeding off any foolish enough to enter its realm. The Warden
is served by a group of ‘Inmates’ – surviving convicts of the
cataclysm since driven mad. They will attack and capture any
in their wake so their master may feed.
The Inmates have the same stats as a Dreg, you can also use
Dreg models to represent Inmates on the tabletop. There are
three Inmates in the scenario; they will work together as a
mob and must stay within 2" of each other at all times. They
will move towards – and charge, if in range – the nearest
warrior. If the Inmates manage to injure a warrior then ignore
the out of action result on the Injury table, instead the warrior
will be treated as stunned for D3 turns. Whilst a warrior is
stunned the Inmates will carry the warrior towards the
Warden (unless impeded by being charged, etc) at a rate of 4"
(they cannot charge or run whilst carrying the warrior). Note
that two Inmates can carry the warrior without reduction in
their movement, however, if reduced to one Inmate then the
remaining Inmate can only move 2" a turn. If they reach the
Warden in time, the stunned warrior is consumed. The
warrior is taken out of action and is considered dead for the
purposes of the campaign.
The Warden has the same statistics and abilities as a
Possessed with two random mutations (players should decide
the randomisation method for themselves). You can also use
a Possessed model or any Chaos Spawn miniature to
represent the Warden on the tabletop (we used a Chaos Troll
```
- Ed) The Warden will move towards – and charge, if in
range – the nearest warrior. If it wins a combat it will move
towards the next nearest warrior.
NOTE: Both the Warden and the Inmates all start the game
within the Gaol and move out of this building towards the
warriors that are closest to it at first and then the warrior
that is closest to them, as described in the rules above.
If a Hero enters the Gaol and remains there until the end of
the game he will gain +1 dice for Exploration (even if an
enemy warrior is present).
    Ending the game
When one of the warbands fails its Rout test, the game ends.
The routing Warband loses and their opponents win.
    Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle.
+1 Winning Leader. The Leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action (this includes the
Inmates).
+2 Slaying the Warden. Should a Hero or Henchman group
put the Warden out of action they gain +2 Experience.

##### Scenario: Executioner’s Square

By Nick Kyme and Andy Hall
One of the oldest places in Mordheim, Executioner’s Square was
named for obvious reasons, the daily executions were a crowd
puller making the area busy and surrounding businesses successful.
Now the gallows and chopping block stand deserted amongst the
rubble. Since Mordheim’s downfall the many victims of
Executioner’s square – the guilty and innocent alike - have returned
as restless spirits eager to scream their anger at all who pass or
linger.
Both warbands have come to Executioner’s Square with one
purpose – to fight. Such places are often the arena for so-called
‘pitched battles’, open, bloody and vicious. Little do they realise of
the latent spirits, yearning to vent their anger against them.
Terrain
This scenario is played on a 4' x 4' playing area as normal. No
buildings can be placed in a central 2' x 2' area although they
can be placed along this boundary as this represents the
square. Rubble pieces and other such flotsam can be placed in
around the square as normal. In the centre of the square, place
a piece of terrain to represent the gallows and/or chopping
block. Place terrain in the remaining gaming area as normal.
The scenario works best if this is particularly dense.
Set-up
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score
decides which warband sets up first. In the case of a tie, the
warband with the lowest rating may choose. The first player
chooses the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all of
his warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within
8" of the opposite edge.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with highest score takes
the first turn. If the result is a tie the player with the smaller
warband, in terms of actual models, may choose to go first or
second.

```
Special rules
Anger of the Damned: The restless spirits of Executioner’s
Square vent their eternal anger at any who roam in or close to
the square. They manifest as concentrated and violent gusts
of wind; the howling is their screams of rage. At the
beginning of each players turn roll a D6. On a roll of 1 the
spirits stay silent and nothing happens this turn. If the result
is a 2 or more a spirit attacks. If the number is even (2, 4, 6)
then the player whose turn it is must choose one of his
warriors to be attacked. If the number is odd (3, 5) then his
opponent must choose one of the controlling player’s
warriors to be attacked. Note it is always the player whose
turn it is that is attacked by spirits, the only difference is
whether or not he or his opponent chooses the affected
model.
An attacked warrior is automatically hit by a Strength 2
attack (no armour modifiers) and is blown directly backwards
D6". If an attacked warrior is in an elevated position such as
a gantry or an upper floor of a building then there is a good
chance he may be blown off and if this is the case treat the
model as falling. If a model is blown into a piece of terrain
(such as a mound of rubble or the wall of a building) or
blown into another warrior, friend or foe, then the warrior (or
both warriors if it hits another model) is knocked down but
may get up at the start of his next turn should he survive.
Ending the game
When one of the warbands fails its Rout test, the game ends.
The routing warband loses and their opponents win.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle.
+1 Wining Leader. The Leader of the winning Warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Trophy from the Square. If a Hero manages to stay on
the gallows (or the piece of terrain representing the gallows)
at the centre of the square for one complete turn then he gains
+1 Experience.

##### Scenario: The Great Library

By Andy Tabor
The North-East Quarter of Mordheim was renowned for trade and
learning. When Mordheim was a living city, the crowded labyrinth
of streets and market plazas were called the Merchant's Quarter,
more commonly known as the District of the Flying Horse.
Mordheim became known as the finest market of the city in the
Empire, rivalling even the busiest ports as Marienburg. There were
many traders who would claim that for the right price they could
locate any object for you so desired in a day.
Another notable aspect of the North-Eastern Quarter was the Great
Library. During the rule of the extravagant Count Ignatius
Steinhardt, the library grew extensively to become the largest
building in the entire city. The Count was particularly fond of
collecting mystical and religious tomes. Of course, unwittingly, The
Great Library managed to collect on of the largest deposits of
Daemonic and Necromantic lore in the Empire.
Now after the disaster struck Mordheim Library was engulfed by
flames from the comet. Only the bravest ever consider going
anywhere near the ruins but the lure of ancient tomes is enough to
persuade mages from across the Empire to hire warbands to
retrieve any books that they can find. For enough gold, fools can
find enough bravery to risk even this dark place.
(Credit given to TC 25 Space McQuirk and Nick Jakos.)
Terrain
Each player will take it in turn to place a piece of terrain,
either a small building, or other piece of terrain. If you have
one piece of terrain or several that could “act” as the Library
should be placed in the middle. Many of the tomes have been
spewed across the many blocks close to the Library. The
battle is fought in an area roughly 4' x 4'. You may want to
make the table larger if this is to be a multiplayer game.
Special Rules & Set Up
Players should then place D3 +1 Tomes for each warband
involved in the game on the tabletop to represent where the
Tomes are. Each player takes it in turn to place a Tome
counter. The counters must be placed more than 10” away
from the edge of the table and at least 6” away from each
other. Note that counters are placed before deciding which
edge the warbands will play from. A warrior can carry any
amount of Tomes without any penalty. Warriors cannot
transfer their Tomes to another warrior. If a warrior is put
OOA then the Tome is placed next to where the model was
taken OOA. The Tomes cause FEAR. You must take a FEAR
test to pick one up, unless you are immune to FEAR. This is
to represent the great unknown on whether or not the Tomes
are Evil. To represent the chaotic nature of the disaster and
the many magic tomes that are scattered in the area warbands
will roll on the Random Happenings.
Warbands will begin rolling on the Random Happenings
chart when the first model touches a tome and will continue
then at the beginning of each warbands turn. Yes, the first
warband that touches a Tome will roll on the Random
Happenings chart even though it will already be in the middle
of their turn. Please exempt rolls of 11, 45, 54, and 65 from
the D66, just roll again.

```
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 to determine who goes first. Play
proceeds clockwise around the table.
Ending the game
The game ends when all the warbands but one have failed
their Rout Test. Warbands that Rout, automatically lose. If
two or more warbands have allied they may choose to share
the victory and end the game, or they may continue the game
until one warband is victorious.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader(s). The leader of the winning
warband(s) gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per each Tome Picked Up. If a Hero or Henchmen is
carrying a Tome counter at the end of the game he receives
+1 Experience.
+1 For the Warband with the Most Tomes. The leader of
the warband with the most tomes at the end of the game gains
+1 Experience.
Ill Gotten Gains...
You can sell the Tomes for 25 +1D6 or choose to keep the
scroll. If you keep a scroll then roll on the chart below (1D6).
Rolling on the chart below will represent that the Hero has
decided to open the scroll and is trying to decipher its
abilities. Please nominate which Hero will be opening the
scroll.
D6 Events
```
1. The Hero who keeps the scroll will set out the next
    game. You may come up with some creative on why
    he cannot play the next game from opening the scroll.
2. The Hero who keeps the scroll will gain +1 Initiative.
    This can take you above our racial Maximum.
3-5. The Hero who keeps the scroll will gain an Academic
    Skill. Those who normally cannot gain a Academic
    Skill can gain one (1) Academic Skill. Please note that
    this is for only one time and does not grant the user to
    gain Academic Skills through normal experience.
6. The Hero who opens the scroll will gain D3
    experience.

##### Scenario: The Middle Bridge

By Andy Tabor
The Middle Bridge is the main crossing point for the City of the
Damned. Whoever holds the bridge controls all aspects of movement
in Mordheim. The bridge is rumoured to have piles of Wyrdstone or
Treasure around it but are said to be guarded by massive Trolls,
who have a strange affinity for bridges.
Terrain
The gaming table can be as big as 4' x 4' or small as 2' x 2'.
You can easily make a bridge and river out of coloured paper
or plastic.
Special Rules
Place D3 +1 Trolls for each warband in the water and within
6” inches of the bridge. Place 1 Troll for each warband in the
middle of the bridge and the remainder Trolls should be
placed in the water. I would suggest that this scenario be
limited to one to two warbands. You can have one warband
go at a time to secure the bridge or have two warbands
attempt capture and control the bridge, while fighting off the
Trolls. In addition to the normal rules for Trolls, please use
the special rules below if you like.
Fog. The area will be affected by fog. Movement and
shooting distance will be halved. You may charge as normal.
Dumb Creatures of Habit. The Trolls under the bridge have
become so practiced and cunning at taking out travellers what
when a Troll is within 6” inches of the bridge it is allowed to
take Stupidity tests at double their normal leadership (all the
way up to 8). The Trolls will stay within 6” inches of the
bridge at all times.
Massive Troll. The Wyrdstone collected by the Trolls have
made them stronger. Their wounds and attacks are now 4
versus 3.
All Alone. Trolls are used to being all alone and will ignore
this rule.
Route Tests. Trolls will ignore all route tests.
River Trolls. Enemies attempting HTH with the Troll suffer
a -1 to hit. A roll of a 6 will always hit.

```
Warbands
All players roll a D6 to see who deploys first, with the player
rolling the highest choosing the table edge.
Starting the game
Players each roll a D6 to determine who goes first. Play
proceeds clockwise around the table from there. The Troll
will always go last.
Ending the game
The game ends when all but one warband has failed their
route test. The routers will automatically lose.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+2 per Troll out of Action. Any Hero earns +2 Experiences
for each Troll he puts out of action.
Winning Warband Rewards
The winning warband may gain a onetime 5D6 gold. This
will represent collecting tolls from other warbands and
merchants who peddle their wares and will be able to choose
the next scenario they play by hearing rumours from
travellers passing through.
Optional Rules
If you are playing a structured map based campaign this is an
excellent scenario to gain control over parts of Mordheim.
There are many more additions you can make to this
scenario. You can tie it into the Encampment Rules. Another
option could a continued revenue generator throughout the
campaign, thus allowing the warband who controls the bridge
some revenue generated weekly or monthly. All this can
easily be decided by your gaming group. Your gaming group
can also change the type of monsters that live at the bridge. If
someone chooses to stand off and shoot at the Trolls from a
distance and keeping the Trolls within 6” inches of the bridge
shall punished with a Chaos Spawn coming onto the playing
table from their deployment and moving as fast as possible
towards that warband to engage in HTH with that warband.
You can be creative in this endeavour and punish those
warbands who have no backbone.

##### Scenario: The Cemetery of St. Voller

By Nick Kyme and Andy Hall
A grim and foreboding place, the Cemetery of St Voller had a dire
reputation even before the comet struck and changed Mordheim
forever. Now, the cemetery is a haunted place, where the dead do
not rest easy. Indeed, many of the graves are open and the numerous
tombs and mausoleums of the city’s more opulent patrons, cracked
like rotting wounds. Though whether this is from the attentions of
ambitious grave robbers or the stirrings of the unquiet dead, who
knows...
One warband is out searching the cemetery’s grounds for loot, in
part at their Priest’s behest and to pilfer what remains on the
corpses of the rich and influential. The cemetery, though, is vast and
the warband spread thin. In the shadows of a vast statue, depicting
the cemetery’s patron they are set upon by another warband, lying
in wait...
Terrain
Starting with the attacker, each player takes it in turn to place
a piece of terrain. As the warbands are battling in a cemetery,
there should be a large number of graves, mausoleums, tombs
etc. Some of these can be erected on mounds and some
should be open. In the centre of the battlefield should be a
large statue – the image representing St. Voller. We suggest
that the terrain is set up in an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up

1. The defending player rolls a D6 for each Hero and
Henchman group in his warband, in any order he chooses. On
a 1-3, they are elsewhere in the ruins and turn up later as
reinforcements. On a 4-6 they are deployed at the start of the
game.
Note that at least one Hero or Henchmen group will be
present at the start. If all roll 1-3, the last Hero or Henchmen
group will automatically be deployed at the start of the battle.
2. The defender deploys his available Heroes and Henchmen
on the table. No model may be closer than 8" to another
model, as the warband is spread out wide to search the ruins.
No model may be deployed closer than 8" to a table edge.
3. The attacker deploys his whole warband within 8" of a
random table edge, as shown below. He may choose which
edge to nominate as ‘1’ before rolling to see where he
deploys.
    Starting the game
The attacker always gets the first turn. However, if the
warband has a Priest of Morr, they will automatically get the
first turn instead. Note if both warbands have this Priest of
Morr, then the attacker goes first.

```
Special rules
Reinforcements: The defender, at the start of his second and
subsequent turns, may roll a D6 for each of his Henchmen
groups or Heroes not yet on the table. On a 4+ they move on
in the movement phase from a random table edge, roll a D6
(Starting at the table edge to nominate as ‘1’ and going
clockwise for edges 2, 3 & 4. On a roll of a 5 the defending
player may freely choose which edge they will deploy from,
but on a roll of a 6 the attacking player may choose which
edge they will deploy from) All reinforcements for that turn
arrive from the same edge and may charge on the turn in
which they arrive.
Open graves: Open graves are treated like being on the edge
of a ledge for warriors within 1" of them. If a model falls into
an open grave they suffer a Strength 2 hit and must climb 2"
to get out next turn.
The Unquiet Dead: After each player has taken a turn and
always rolling at the start player’s turn who went first, roll a
D6. On a roll of 1 or 2, D3+1 zombies (these are the same as
the Undead warband Henchmen on page 89 of the Mordheim
rulebook) emerge from the graves. These models are be
placed by the player with the lowest warband rating within 1"
of any grave. The zombies don’t move and attack until the
end of the second player’s turn. They will always move
towards the nearest model, choosing a living one, if they are
equidistant, and charging if possible. Note, they will even
attack other Undead models but not if they are also the
Unquiet Dead.
The Statue of St. Voller: Though Mordheim is lost and a
wholly depraved place, the spirit of St. Voller still exerts
some guardianship over the cemetery. Any of the Unquiet
Dead that rise from the graves may not move within 3" of the
statue as its holy aura repels them.
Ending the game
The game ends when one warband fails a Rout test. The
routing warband loses.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the battle
they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband gains
+1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy (and Unquiet Dead) he puts out of action.

##### Scenario: The Merchant Square

By Andy Tabor
The once thriving Market Square, more commonly known as the
District of the Flying Horse has become a deserted plaza. Only the
exceptionally brave or downright foolhardy dare cross the open
cobbles, where once thousands of merchants sole their wares. To
venture into the Market Square is to expose oneself to all those who
keep a close watch from the surrounding shadow. Many eyes peer
from the dark alleys and ruined buildings, in search of a fresh
opportunity to make a quick killing. There is still a vast quantity of
precious and exotic goods lying in the broken cellars of merchant's
houses for the taking.
It is said that a few of the Pegasi escaped the destruction and their
cages and have made their lairs around this area. Some have
mutated horribly and are twisted diabolic parodies of their former
selves. The infamous of these creatures is said to be a huge Black
Pegasus with several additional horribly mutated heads, that of a
serpent and a ram. Hunger gnaws at the stomachs of these beasts
and they will face many times their number if they catch the scent of
prey.
In a terrible twist of fate, the Merchants Quarter remains the most
opulent region of the accursed city. Should any adventurous soul
wish to visit the ruined library or take a chance and stroll through
the market place, it is highly likely that they may discover some rare
goods that have survived the fall. Leaving the quarter with your life
is a different matter though, for the District of the Flying Horse is
also rich pickings for those who seek to spill blood.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building or something similar. We suggest that the
terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'. The middle
area of the board should free of terrain (maybe a fountain or
the like to mark the centre of the square) and to have at least
a 12” inch x 12” inch square open area. This will represent
the Merchant's Square. The buildings placed outside of the
Merchant's Square will represent the Merchant's Homes and
Shoppe's.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Special rules
Warbands will begin searching the buildings for common
items. Each warband will roll 1D6 for each searchable
building. If they roll a 4+ they found a common item. In the
Merchant's Square, will be D3 crates per warband. The crates
will be placed in the middle of the Merchant's Square. When
a warband touches a crate they must roll a D6. Only one roll
per crate. On a roll of a 1 on a D6, the Black Pegasus will
appear. The Black Pegasus will appear 8” inches in on a
Random Table edge. The Black Pegasus will go in the last
turn and will attempt to fly down on the models in the
Merchant's Square. The Black Pegasus will target the closest
model in the Merchant's Square. Merchant's Square is the 12”
x 12” area in the middle of the table as the streets and alleys
would be too narrow for the Pegasus to fly into.
The profile of the Black Pegasus can be found in the Beasts,
Monsters & Townsfolk section of the Rulebook.

```
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest has the
first turn and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where the players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
When all the crates are off the table, all but one warband has
routed, or the warbands ally.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of a winning warband gain
+1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of Action. Any Hero earn +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per each crate taken off the board. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for taking a crate off the board.
Items
Common items are found in the houses surrounding the
Market's Square. They are kept no matter if you win or loose.
Remember you need to roll a 4+ for each house to see if you
were able to locate a common item. Only one opportunity per
house. Please keep track of what homes you searched so you
can take them off the list.
Item D6 Result Needed
D3 Morning Star 1
D3 Spears 2
D3 Bows 3
D3 Crossbow 4
1 Suit of Heavy Armour 5
D3 Nets 6
Rare items can only come from the crates placed in the
middle of the Merchant's Square. Rare items may only be
found if the crate is taken off the table. If no crates made if
off the table then no Rare Items will be found. You will be
much too nervous looking out for the other warbands and a
Black Pegasus to open the crate in the middle of the
Merchant's Square. When the game ends, the winning
warband(s) does not automatically get the crates.
Item D6 Result Needed
D3 Repeater Crossbow 1
D3 Handgun 2
D3 Healing Herbs 3
1 Gromril Weapon 4
1 Dose Bugman's Ale 5
1 Eleven Cloak 6

### Income

At the end of each battle, a warband may roll on the
Exploration chart. This is done as soon as a game is over so
that players can witness each other’s dice rolls. As you can
see from the chart, a warband that is just starting out has little
chance of finding the more obscure places in Mordheim.
However, a warband will make more discoveries as it goes
along thanks to its better equipment and accumulated skills.
Roll a D6 for each Hero in your warband who survives
without going out of action. This represents the warband’s
efforts to unearth wyrdstone. Do not roll for any Heroes who
went out of action during the battle; they are taken back to
the warband’s encampment to recuperate instead. So, for
example, if your warband includes four Heroes who all
survived the last battle, you can roll four dice. If you won
your last game, you may roll one extra dice. Add the results
of the dice together and consult the Exploration chart to see
how many shards of wyrdstone your warband has found.
Do not roll for Henchmen. This does not mean that they don’t
search the ruins, but instead represents the efforts of the
Heroes in coordinating the search parties. In addition, some
Henchmen like Zombies or Warhounds (for obvious reasons)
are not particularly useful when it comes to looking for
wyrdstone.

#### Rolling multiples

As well as finding shards of wyrdstone, the warband can
come across unusual places or encounter inhabitants of the
ruined city. If you roll two or more of the same number while
searching, you have found an unusual building or
encountered something out of ordinary. Consult the chart and
refer to the appropriate entry in the Exploration results.
For example, you might roll two 3’s or three 5’s, in which
case you should refer to the chart. Choose the most numerous
multiples if you score more than one set of multiples. So, if

```
you rolled a double 3 and a triple 5, only look up the triple 5
on the Exploration chart. In the case of two doubles or triples
look up the highest result. For example, if you rolled double
1 and double 3, look up the double 3 result.
Any money or loot you find in these locations is added
straight to the warband’s treasury. Any shards of wyrdstone
you find can be sold as normal.
```
#### Exploration procedure

1. Roll 1D6 for each of your Heroes who survived the battle and
one extra dice if you won, plus any extra dice allowed by skills
or equipment. Note, however, that you must pick a maximum of
six dice out of all the dice you roll, even if you are allowed to
roll seven dice or more.
2. Some things, such as skills and equipment, (like the
Mordheim Map) may allow you to re-roll dice. If your warband
includes an Elf Ranger, you may modify one dice by +1 or -1.
3. If you rolled any doubles, triples, etc, you have found an
unusual location in Mordheim. Consult the Exploration chart on
the next page to see what you find. Refer to the appropriate entry
on the following pages and follow the instructions given there.
4. Add the results together and consult the chart on the next page
to see how many shards of wyrdstone you have found. Mark
down the amount of wyrdstone on your warband’s roster sheet.
    NUMBER OF WYRDSTONE SHARDS FOUND

##### Doubles

(11) Well
The public wells, of which there were several in Mordheim,
were covered by rooves raised up on pillars and adorned
with carvings and fountains. The city was proud of its water
system. Unfortunately, like all the other wells, this one is in a
parlous state and undoubtedly polluted with wyrdstone.
Choose one of your Heroes and roll a D6. If the result is
equal to or lower than his Toughness, he finds one shard of
wyrdstone at the bottom of the well. If he fails, the Hero
swallows tainted water and must miss the next game through
sickness.

(22) Shop
The Merchants Guild shop has been thoroughly ransacked.
Even so, there are still items scattered around the single,
long room, mingled in with the rubble. Some are useful, such
as cast iron pots and pans and rolls of fine cloth. All manner
of smaller items are lying about – the sort of frippery which
no longer has a use in a devastated city with few inhabitants.
After a thorough search you find loot worth D6 GC.
If you roll a 1 you will also find a Lucky Charm (see the
Equipment section, page 53).

(33) Corpse
You find a still-warm corpse. A chipped dagger sticks out of
his back. Surprisingly, his possessions have not been looted.
To see what you find when you search the corpse, roll a D6:
D6 Result
1-2 D6 GC
3 Dagger
4 Axe
5 Sword
6 Suit of light armour

```
(44) Straggler
Your warband encounters one of the survivors of Mordheim,
who has lost his sanity along with all his worldly possessions.
Skaven warbands can sell the straggler to agents of Clan
Eshin (who will use the man for food or slavery) and gain
2D6 GC.
Possessed warbands can sacrifice the unfortunate individual
for the glory of the Chaos gods. The leader of the warband
will gain +1 Experience.
Undead warbands can kill the man and gain a Zombie for no
cost.
Any other warband can interrogate the man and gain insight
into the city. Next time you roll on the Exploration chart, roll
one dice more than is usually allowed, and discard any one
dice. (For example, if you have three Heroes, roll four dice
and pick any three).
```
```
(55) Overturned Cart
Stuck in a ruined gateway is an overturned wagon – the
covered type that nobles travel in from the city to their estates
in the country. Since anyone important fled a long time ago,
what is it doing here? The horses have broken their traces, or
did someone cut them free?
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 Mordheim Map (see Miscellaneous Equipment)
3-4 A purse with 2D6 GC
5-6 Jewelled sword and dagger. These can be kept or sold
at twice the value of a normal sword and dagger, but
note that the normal selling price is half the actual cost
(see the Trading section for rules on selling items), so
the jewelled sword will sell for 10 GC, for instance.
```
```
(66) Ruined Hovels
The street consists of ruined hovels, which are leaning over
at alarming angles. Not much worth looting here.
You find loot worth D6 GC amidst the ruins.
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 220 Assembled by Paul H


##### Triples

(111) Tavern
The ruin of a tavern is recognisable by its sign still hanging
on the wall. The upper part of the building is ruined, but the
cellars are cut into rock and are still full of barrels. There
are broken flagons and tankards everywhere.
You could easily sell the barrels for a good price.
Unfortunately your men are also interested in the contents!
The warband’s leader must take a Leadership test. If he
passes, the warband gains 4D6 GC worth of wines and ales
which can be sold immediately.
If he fails, the men drink most of the alcohol despite their
leader’s threats and curses. You have D6 GC worth of
alcohol left when the warband reaches their encampment.
Undead, Witch Hunter and Sisters of Sigmar warbands
automatically pass this test, as they are not tempted by such
worldly things as alcohol.

(222) Smithy
The furnace and toppled anvil make it obvious what work
was done here. Most of the iron and the tools have been
looted long ago. Coal and slag litter the floor but there may
still be weapons to be found among the debris.
Roll a D6 to determine what you find inside:
D6 Result
1 Sword
2 Double-handed weapon
3 Flail
4 D3 Halberds
5 Lance
6 2D6 GC worth of metal (add the value to your
treasury).

(333) Prisoners
A muffled sound comes from one of the buildings. Inside you
find a group of finely dressed people who have been locked in
a cellar. Perhaps they are prisoners taken by cultists, ready
to be sacrificed during Geheimnisnacht.
Possessed warbands can sacrifice the victims (undoubtedly
finishing the job of the captors). They gain D3 Experience
which is distributed amongst the Heroes of the warband.
Undead warbands can callously kill the prisoners and gain D3
Zombies at no cost.
Skaven can sell the prisoners into slavery for 3D6 GC.
Other warbands can escort the prisoners out of the city. For
their trouble, they are rewarded with 2D6 GC. In addition,
one of the prisoners decides he wishes to join the warband. If
you can afford to equip the new recruit with weapons and
armour, you may add a new Henchman to any of your human
Henchman groups (with the same stats as the rest of the
group, even if they have already accumulated experience).

```
(444) Fletcher
This hovel was once the workshop of a fletcher – a maker of
bows and arrows. There are bundles of yew staves and
willow rods everywhere.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 D3 Short bows
3 D3 Bows
4 D3 Long bows
5 Quiver of hunting arrows
6 D3 Crossbows
```
```
(555) Market Hall
The market hall was raised up on pillars, with the timbered
corn exchange above the open market place. The upper
storey has been badly damaged, but the covered market still
offers a good deal of shelter. The remains of the last market
day are still lying around on the cobbles. Most of this is
broken pottery and iron pots.
You find several items worth 2D6 GC in total.
```
```
(666) Returning a Favour
As you are returning to your encampment, you meet one of
your old acquaintances. He has come to repay an old favour
or debt.
You gain the services of any one Hired Sword (choose from
those available to your warband) for the duration of the next
battle, free of charge. After the battle he will depart, or you
may continue to pay for his upkeep as normal. See the Hired
Swords section on page 219.
```
Assembled By Paul H Page 221 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


##### Four of a kind

(1111) Gunsmith
You find the workshop of a Dwarf gunsmith. Its doors have
been broken down and the rooms raided, but some of the iron
strongboxes have survived intact.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1 Blunderbuss
2 Brace of pistols
3 Brace of duelling pistols
4 D3 Handguns
5 D3 Flasks of superior blackpowder
6 Hochland long rifle

(2222) Shrine
Your warband stumbles across a ruined shrine, which is so
badly damaged that it is difficult to tell which god was once
worshipped within its walls. A few images remain on the
painted plaster walls but they have been defaced by heretics.
Fragments of smashed statues lie among the ruins. Some
items appear to be covered in gold leaf, most of which has
been torn off.
Your warband may strip the shrine and gain 3D6 GC worth
of loot.
Sisters of Sigmar or Witch Hunter warbands may save some
of the shrine’s holy relics. They will gain 3D6 GC from their
patrons, and a blessing from the gods. One of their weapons
(chosen by the player) will now be blessed and will always
wound any Undead or Possessed model on a to wound roll of
2+.

(3333) Townhouse
This three-storey house was once part of a tenement block
overlooking a narrow alleyway. The street is now in ruins,
but this house remains largely intact. Exploring it you find
that the garret leans over so far that you can step out of the
window into the attic of the house opposite.
Your warband finds 3D6 GC worth of loot.

```
(4444) Armourer
A breastplate hanging from a pole drew your attention to this
place, obviously too high up to be easily looted. The
workshop is ruined and the forge has been smashed. Rooting
about in the soot, you find various half-finished items of
armour.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 D3 Shields or bucklers (choose which)
3 D3 Helmets
4 D3 Suits of light armour
5 D3 Suits of heavy armour
6 Suit of Ithilmar armour
```
```
(5555) Graveyard
You find an old graveyard, crammed with sepulchres that are
overgrown with ivy. The monuments to the dead are
grotesque and decorated with sculpted gargoyles. The
ironwork has been ripped from some of the tombs, and stones
have toppled off. It looks as if some of the crypts have
already been broken into by tomb robbers.
Any warband apart from Witch Hunters and Sisters of Sigmar
may loot the crypts and graves and gains D6x10 GC worth of
loot.
If you loot the graveyard, the next time you play against
Sisters of Sigmar or Witch Hunters, the entire enemy
warband will hate all the models in your warband. Make a
note of this on your warband roster sheet.
Witch Hunters and Sisters of Sigmar may seal the graves.
They will be rewarded for their piety by D6 Experience
points distributed amongst the Heroes of the warband.
```
```
(6666) Catacombs
You find an entrance to the catacombs and tunnels below
Mordheim.
You can use the new tunnels you found in the next battle you
play. Position up to three fighters (not Rat Ogres or the
Possessed) anywhere on the battlefield at ground level. They
are set up at the end of the player’s first turn and cannot be
placed within 8" of any enemy models.
This represents the warriors making their way through the
tunnels, infiltrating enemy lines and emerging suddenly from
below ground.
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 222 Assembled by Paul H


##### Five of a kind

(11111) Moneylender’s House
A grand mansion, that is strongly built from stone, has
survived the cataclysm remarkably well. A carved coat of
arms adorns the lintel above the doorway although it has
been defaced by raiders and the symbols are now
unrecognisable. The door itself, has been smashed open with
axes and hangs open on its hinges.
Inside, hidden amongst the debris, you find D6x10 GC to add
to your treasury.

(22222) Alchemist’s Laboratory
A narrow stairway leads down into a crypt-like dwelling
which was once an alchemist’s workshop. The sign still
hangs from one hinge above the entrance. It looks as if this
was a very old building which has remained in use for
centuries although it did not survive the comet’s destruction
too well. The stone floor has strange symbols on it and there
are charts and astrological symbols painted onto the walls.
In the ruins you find loot worth 3D6 GC and a battered old
notebook. One of your Heroes may study the Alchemist’s
notebook, and the extra wisdom he gains will enable him to
choose from Academic skills whenever he gains a new skill
in addition to those skills normally available to him.

(33333) Jewelsmith
The houses in the jewellers’ quarter have all been well and
truly looted long ago. Even the rubble has been picked over
many times for fragments of gold and gems. But still, some
small but valuable items may have been overlooked.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 Quartz stones worth D6x5 GC
3-4 Amethyst worth 20 GC
5 Necklace worth 50 GC
6 A ruby worth D6x15 GC
If your warband does not sell the gems, one of your Heroes
may keep them and displays them proudly. He will gain +1 to
the rolls for locating rare items as merchants flock to such an
obviously wealthy warrior.

```
(44444) Merchant’s House
The merchant’s house stands by the waterfront. It has a
vaulted stone undercroft which is still stacked with barrels
and bales of cloth. The foodstuffs have been looted or eaten
long ago and huge rats infest the rotting bales. Up the stairs
are the dwelling quarters, solidly built of timber, although
badly damaged you think you can still get up to them but
you’ll need to tread with care!
Inside you find several valuable objects which can be sold for
2D6x5 GC. If you roll a double, instead of finding money
you find the symbol of the Order of Freetraders. A Hero in
possession of this gains the Haggle skill.
```
```
(55555) Shattered Building
The comet destroyed this building almost completely, making
it unsafe for all but the most daring to explore. But places
such as this are the best for searching for wyrdstone shards.
You find D3 shards of wyrdstone amongst the ruins. In
addition take a Leadership test against the warband leader’s
Leadership value. If passed a war dog that was guarding the
building joins the warband.
```
```
(66666) Entrance to the Catacombs
You find a well-hidden entrance to the dark catacombs which
extend for miles beneath the city of Mordheim. Although the
entrance looks foreboding the tunnels will take hours off your
searches of the city.
You can use these tunnels to explore Mordheim more
efficiently. From now on, you may re-roll one dice when you
roll on the Exploration chart. Make a note of this in your
warband’s roster sheet. Second and subsequent catacomb
entrances you find do not grant you any additional re-rolls,
although you may find further re-rolls from other sources.
```
Assembled By Paul H Page 223 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


##### Six of a kind

(111111) The Pit
You have come within sight of the Pit, the huge crater created
by the comet. A black cloud still rises from it but you can see
glowing wyrdstone everywhere. This is the domain of the
Shadow Lord, the lord of the Possessed, and no-one is
welcome here – even his own followers!
If you wish, you can send one of your Heroes to search for
any wyrdstone hidden here. Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 the Hero
is devoured by the guardians of the Pit and never seen again.
On a roll of 2 or more he returns with D6+1 shards of
wyrdstone.

(222222) Hidden Treasure
In the depths of Mordheim, you come across a hidden chest,
bearing the coat-of-arms of one of the noble families of the
town.
When you open the chest you find the following items. Roll
for every item on the list separately (apart from the gold
crowns) to see whether you have found it. For example, on a
roll of a 4+ you find the wyrdstone.
Items D6 Result Needed
D3 Pieces of wyrdstone 4+
5D6x5 GC Auto
Holy relic 5+
Suit of heavy armour 5+
D3 Gems worth 10 GC each 4+
Elven cloak 5+
Holy tome 5+
Magical artefact 5+

(333333) Dwarf Smithy
You find a solidly built stone workshop. A runic inscription
indicates that this may have been a Dwarf smithy.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:

D6 Result
1 D3 Double-handed axes
2 D3 Suits of heavy armour
3 Gromril axe
4 Gromril hammer
5 Double-handed gromril axe
6 Gromril armour

```
(444444) Slaughtered Warband
You find the remains of an entire warband. Broken bodies lay
scattered among the ruins, torn apart by some monstrous
creature. You see a huge shape, which looks like an immense
Possessed creature, shambling away.
After giving the dead their final rites (Sisters of Sigmar or
Witch Hunters), eating them (Skaven or Undead) or looting
them (anyone else!) you find the following items. Roll for
every item separately (apart from the gold coins and daggers)
to see if you find it. For example, on a roll of 4+ you will find
the suits of light armour.
Item D6 Result Needed
3D6x5 GC Auto
D3 Suits of light armour 4+
Suit of heavy armour 5+
D6 Daggers Auto
Mordheim Map 4+
D3 Halberds 5+
D3 Swords 3+
D3 Shields 2+
D3 Bows 4+
D3 Helmets 2+
```
```
(555555) Fighting Arena
During better times, Mordheim was famous for its duellists
and pit fighters. You have found one of the areas used to
train these warriors. The place is filled with training
equipment and practice weapons.
You find a training manual, which you can either sell for 100
GC or let one of your Heroes read. The extra knowledge your
Hero gleans from reading the manual entitles him to choose
from Combat skills whenever he gains a new skill, and his
WS may now be increased by an extra point above his normal
racial maximum (for example, a Human who has the book
would now have a maximum Weapon Skill of 7).
```
```
(666666) Noble’s Villa
You find a fine house which is partially ruined. It has been
thoroughly ransacked and all the furniture has been stripped
of its fine fabrics. Shards of broken pottery of the finest
quality are scattered over the floor.
Roll a D6. If you roll 1-2, you find D6x10 GC worth of items
and money to add to your treasury. On a roll of 3-4, you find
D6 vials of Crimson Shade. On a roll of 5-6 you find a
hidden magical artefact carefully concealed in a hidden cellar
or behind a secret door. Roll on the Magical Artefacts table.
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 224 Assembled by Paul H


#### Magical artefacts table

Roll a D6 and use this table to determine which item you find when a result in the Exploration chart indicates that you have
found a magical artefact. In a campaign none of these items can appear more than once, so if you find a magic item which
is already in someone else’s possession roll again – even if the warrior carrying it has been killed.
1 The Boots and Rope of Pieter
Pieter, the master thief of the Guild of Shadows, was the most
famous of all the cat burglars of Mordheim. He earned the
nickname ‘Spider’ for his daring robberies. The secret of his
success was a pair of enchanted boots and a magical rope
which he had acquired from far-off Araby.
A model wearing these boots may move normally (including
running, charging, etc) on any kind of terrain, including
vertical surfaces. When moving the model, simply adds the
distances moved horizontally to that moved vertically, with
no Initiative test needed (except to jump across gaps).

2 The Count of Ventimiglia’s Misericordia
This dagger was used by the notorious Tilean gentleman-
pirate known as the ‘Black Corsair’. It is claimed that he
found it in ancient Elven ruins and legend also has it that the
dagger’s blade cannot be damaged in any way.
The dagger is treated as a sword. Opponents wounded by it
are Stunned on a result of 1-3 (Undead are Knocked Down as
normal) and put Out Of Action on a 4-6.

3 Att’la’s Plate Mail
This armour was given as a present by the Dwarf Lord
Kurgan to the warlord Att’la in the time of Sigmar
Heldenhammer.
Att’la’s Plate Mail is a suit of Gromril armour with the
following three runes inscribed on it:
Rune of Spell Eating: The Hero wearing this
armour is immune to all spells.
Rune of Passage: The Hero can move through solid
objects, like walls (this does not mean that he can
see through them).
Rune of Fortitude: The Hero has an extra wound.
Note that this may take his total Wounds above his
race’s maximum.

```
4 Bow of Seeking
This bow was a gift to Count Steinhardt from the Elf lords of
the Forest of Shadows.
Any arrow shot using this magic bow will pursue the target
and hit it even if the target is behind cover. Treat this as an
Elven bow that always hits on a 2+, regardless of any to hit
modifier. Such is its deadly precision that all the arrows shot
with this weapon count as Hunting Arrows (+1 on all Injury
rolls).
Pick any enemy model in range, not just the closest, but the
shooter must be able to see the target (even the tip of a
target’s weapon is enough – as long as the shooter is aware of
the presence and position of the target, he can shoot). In
addition, if any Dwarf is an eligible target, the arrows will
always deviate from their intended target and try to hit the
Dwarf instead. For obvious reasons this bow cannot be used
to shoot at Elves.
```
```
5 Executioner’s Hood
Recovered from a shipwrecked Dark Elf vessel, this hood
carries evil glowing runes which fill the wearer with
unreasoning rage.
A warrior wearing this becomes subject to and always will be
frenzied even if he is knocked down or stunned. He also adds
+1 to his Strength in close combat, such is the power of his
fury. The wearer never leaves combat under any
circumstances, and will always attack opponents in base
contact until they are taken out of action.
If there are any stunned or knocked down models within the
wearer’s charge range at the beginning of his turn, he will
charge and attack the closest one, even if they are members
of his own warband! Fight the hand-to-hand combat until one
of the warriors is taken out of action.
```
```
6 All-Seeing Eye of Numas
This jewel was recovered from the ruins of Numas far in the
south. It gives its wielder horrific nightmares that predict his
future.
The bearer of the All-Seeing Eye can see all models on the
table top, even if they are hidden or out of sight. He can guide
his fellow warband members through the ruins (this allows
you to roll two dice for the bearer after battle when rolling on
the Exploration chart). The bearer also has an additional 6+
save (which is not modified by Strength or weapon
modifiers) against all shooting attacks and strikes in close
combat, as he can sense the attacks before they are made.
All animals (such as War dogs, horses, etc) will be affected
by frenzy when fighting against the bearer of the All-Seeing
Eye.

#### Selling wyrdstone

Wyrdstone is tremendously valuable and is in constant
demand by Imperial nobles. This means that finding buyers
for your warband’s wyrdstone is not difficult. You do not
have to sell all your wyrdstone immediately after the battle –
you may want to hoard it and sell it later, as selling
wyrdstone in smaller quantities will increase demand and
raise the price. Unfortunately, the demands of running a
warband often mean that you will have to sell most of your
wyrdstone as soon as you find it.
The warband must spend a large portion of its income on
basic necessities such as food, drink, repair of weapons, and
new arrows and ammunition, as well as celebrating! A
warband leader is also expected to share any profits made by
selling wyrdstone between his men which means that the
more money the warband makes from such sales, the bigger
the share for the men.
The more models there are in the warband, the more it costs
to maintain and the higher the level of any profits made that
must be shared between the men. The number indicated on
the following chart is the profit in gold crowns earned after
deducting the warband’s maintenance costs. The profit is
added to warband’s treasury.

#### Sisters of Sigmar and income

```
Worldly possessions mean little to the Sisters, but their holy
mission to purify Mordheim of the influence of Chaos
requires supplies and weaponry, and these are much in
demand. Thus the warbands of the Sisterhood compete with
each other to gain the best weapons and equipment from the
temple’s armoury.
To measure their success, the more wyrdstone the Sisters
bring to be kept under lock and key in the Vault of
Vindication in the temple at Sigmar’s Rock, the more aid
they will receive from the temple.
Thus all gold crowns in the possession of a Sisters of Sigmar
warband represent the resources that the High Matriarch will
put at their disposal. It does not represent money in a literal
sense, so you may like to think of it as faith, piety,
dedication, etc.
```
#### Skaven and Undead

```
Neither of these warbands puts much value on gold, but they
send all the wyrdstone they find to their superiors and receive
aid and resources in return. Skaven use their own currency
for trading, while the Undead are somewhat beyond petty
concepts of wealth. For Skaven, the gold crowns in the
warband’s treasury represent the warp tokens which the
Skaven use for currency, while for the Undead it represents
the favour they enjoy in the eyes of their master, Vlad von
Carstein of Sylvania.
```
#### Spending income

```
You can spend any accumulated money on weapons, armour,
hiring new warriors, buying new equipment or simply save
the money for a bigger purchase. See the Trading section for
details.
```
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 226 Assembled by Paul H


### Tr a ding

Every Settlement around the city of Mordheim has at least
one trading post, shop or merchant’s guildhouse where the
local traders sell their wares and buy wyrdstone and other
items that have been scavenged from the ruins. In a large
village such a place might cover a substantial area with many
traders and merchants offering their goods and services.
Small settlements are served by travelling traders.
All warbands are able to get new equipment one way or
another. The most unscrupulous merchants actively trade
with the Possessed Cultists, and creatures such as the Skaven
have their own network of contacts, while Vampires can send
the Dregs that serve them into the less salubrious settlements
around Mordheim, such as Cutthroats’ Haven.

#### Spending cash

After every game, a warband can collect income from
exploration, etc, and sell any wyrdstone and treasures they
have acquired. Cash can be spent on recruiting new warriors,
or on new equipment for the warband.
The price of wyrdstone varies according to current demand.
See the Income section for details.

#### New recruits

New warriors are recruited in the same way as the original
warband with the notable exception of equipment. After the
start of a campaign, a new hireling can only buy Common
items from his warband’s equipment chart freely. He may
only be given Rare items from his warband’s equipment chart
if the warband can obtain them via the normal trading rules.
Warbands may recruit whatever type of warriors the player
wishes, but the usual restrictions apply regarding the number
of Heroes, Henchmen, wizards, etc. For example, no warband
may recruit a second leader, and no Mercenary warband can
have more than two Champions.

#### Recruiting hired swords

Players may hire mercenary warriors known as ‘Hired
Swords’ for the warband if they wish. See the Hired Swords
section starting on page 229.

#### New recruits and existing henchmen

#### groups

You may add new recruits to existing Henchman groups. If
the group is relatively inexperienced, you will have no
difficulty in finding raw recruits to add to their numbers. But
more experienced gnarled veterans are not so keen on letting
novice warriors join them – and quite rightly so! Between
each battle, roll 2D6: this represents the experience of the
warriors currently available for hire. You can hire as many
warriors as you wish, as long as their combined Experience
does not exceed your dice roll. For example, if you rolled 7,
you could add a single warrior to a Henchman group with 7
Experience points, or two warriors to a Henchman group with
3 Experience points, or any combination thereof. Disregard
any excess Experience points.
As with other new Henchmen, you must pay for all their
weapons and armour, and in addition you must add 2 gold
crowns to their cost for each extra Experience point they add
to the warband’s total. New Henchmen must be armed and
equipped in the same way as existing members of the group.

#### Weapons

```
If a player wants to buy new weapons or other equipment for
existing warriors, refer to the Price chart that follows. The
chart lists all the equipment available in Mordheim, not just
the common weapons included in the Recruitment charts.
Rare items and weapons are not always available and vary in
price. Remember that your warriors lack the skill to use any
weapons other than the ones listed in the Recruitment charts.
You may still want to buy rare items offered to you, as your
warriors may be able to use them as they gain in experience.
Players should preferably complete any recruiting and trading
after the battle is over, making the appropriate dice rolls
whilst both players are present.
However, some players may prefer to wait until the heat of
battle has cooled and they are able to consider purchases
more carefully. Determine which rare items are offered for
sale while both players are together. The players can work
out what they will buy later.
```
#### Trading

```
Trade items are divided into two sections: common and rare
items. Common items can be bought quite readily in any of
the numerous trading posts and settlements around
Mordheim. Players may purchase as many of these items as
they want. The price of common items is fixed, so players
always pay the same rate for them.
Rare items are hard or even impossible to come by. Only
occasionally do such items turn up for sale and the price
asked is often way above the true value. These items are
often offered only to the most famous warbands, or those
with the most money.
```
#### Availability

```
The Price chart has a column marked ‘Availability’. Common
items are always available, and can be bought in any
quantity. Items marked ‘rare’ are more difficult to find. A
rare item’s availability is indicated by a number, for example
‘Rare 9’.
Whenever a Hero wants to buy a rare item, roll 2D6 and
compare the result to the number stated. If the roll is equal or
greater, the item is available. For example, you need to roll 9
or more to acquire an item marked ‘Rare 9’. You can only
buy one rare item for each successful roll. You may also only
make one roll for each Hero looking for rare items. For
example, if your warband has four Heroes, you may make
four rolls to locate rare items. Warriors taken out of action
during the last battle may not look for rare items.

#### Selling

A player may trade in weapons and equipment at the same
time he buys new ones. After all, as warbands become more
powerful they often abandon their earlier armament in favour
of something better. However, the second-hand value of
equipment is not high due to the considerable wear and tear
inflicted on it by your warriors.
Warriors can automatically sell equipment for half its listed
price. In the case of rare equipment and weapons which have
a variable price, the warband receives half of the basic cost
only (merchants are far better at haggling than your warriors).
Alternatively, weapons, armour and equipment may be
hoarded for future use (make a note on the warband roster) or
swapped around the warband from one fighter to another
(though not between warbands). As a weapon’s value is low
compared to the cost of equipping any new recruits you may
get, a warband can usually find a use for its cast-off
armaments.

#### Price chart

The following chart indicates the cost of items available for sale at trading posts. The cost of rare items is included, but such items cannot
be bought unless they are available, as already described. In some cases the price is variable, and includes a basic cost plus a variable
extra amount, for example 20+3D6 gold crowns. For these items the extra variable cost reflects the rarity of the item – the premium
which must be paid to buy it.

### Hired Swords

#### Recruiting hired swords

This section introduces Hired Swords – professional
mercenaries – to Mordheim campaign games. Taverns in the
settlements and shanty towns around Mordheim are good
recruitment centres for warriors who do not belong to any
particular warband or retinue, but instead hire out their
services to the highest bidder.
A player can recruit Hired Swords when he creates his
warband, or during the campaign phase after a game. Hired
Swords do not count towards the maximum number of
warriors or Heroes a warband may have on its roster and
don’t affect your income from selling wyrdstone. However,
Hired Swords do count as part of the warband for purposes of
Rout tests, etc whilst in battle. A player can buy extra
weapons or equipment for a Hired Sword, however once a
weapon or piece of equipment is given to a Hired Sword it
cannot be taken back and he cannot sell the Hired Sword’s
weapons or equipment. To reflect their rarity, you can only
have one of each type of Hired Sword in your warband. You
may not use the Leadership of any of the Hired Swords for
Rout tests.

#### Hire fee

```
When a warband recruits a Hired Sword, you must pay his
hire fee. Subsequently, after each battle he fights, including
the first, you must pay his upkeep fee if you want him to
remain with the warband. If the Hired Sword is killed, or you
no longer require his services, you don’t have to pay any
upkeep! These costs are indicated in the entries for each
Hired Sword.
The money paid to Hired Swords comes from the warband’s
treasury in the same way as buying new weapons or
recruiting new warriors. If you don’t have enough gold to pay
for the Hired Sword, or want to spend it on other things, he
leaves the warband. Any experience he has gained will be
lost, even if you hire a new Henchman of the same type.
```
#### Injuries

```
If a Hired Sword goes out of action during the game, roll for
his injuries as you would roll for a Hero after a battle.
```
#### Hired swords and experience

```
Hired Swords gain experience in exactly the same way as a
Hero. Refer to the scenarios to find out how much experience
Hired Swords gain after each game. Write the name and
profile of a Hired Sword on your roster sheet in one of the
Hero slots. Once the Hired Sword gains enough experience
for an advance, roll on the Heroes Advancement table (as
opposed to Henchmen) to determine which advance he gains.
Skills available to the Hired Swords are listed under their
entries.

#### Hired Sword List

##### Arabian Merchant

By Nick Kyme
From the lands of eternal desert they come, crossing the sea to
reach the Empire, in search of the city spoken of in frightened
whispers and imagined in childhood nightmares; Mordheim – City
of the Damned.
Not all hirelings are warriors and the merchants of Araby are not
known for their martial prowess. Rather they are advisers, treasure
seekers and collectors of the arcane. Found within the shady
bazaars of seldom trodden streets and darkened taverns, they have
an uncanny knack of finding the best equipment for the best price,
tapping into the vein-like underworld network of black markets and
foreign traders providing for any would-be adventurers.
Experts in treasure and antiques, they seek their own fortune in the
forgotten artefacts buried deep beneath the city but require a
warband’s protection. Reciprocal then is this relationship. Although
keen to avoid conflict, their employers’ keep them close at hand, as
a smooth talking merchant is not to be trusted when treasure and
glory is at stake...
20 Gold Crowns +10 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Arabian Merchant may be hired by
Lawful, Lawful / Neutral and Neutral warbands.
Rating: An Arabian Merchant increases a warband's rating
by 10 points plus 1 point for each Experience point the
Arabian Merchant has.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Arabian Merchant 4 2 2 3 3 1 4 1 7
Weapons/Armour: Scimitar (counts as a sword).
Skills: A Merchant may choose from Academic skills when
he gains a new skill (he also has his own special skill that he
can choose – see below).
Special Rules
Haggle: As in the Academic skill in the rulebook.
Pawnbroker: The Merchant is skilled in finding the best
price for sold items and as such gains an extra 2D6 gold per
item that the warband sells (up to its full value) if he was not
taken out of action in the battle.
Marketeer: The Merchant has many useful contacts in the
black market underworld and foreign traders to locate many
special items. After each battle (if he wasn’t taken out of
action) the Merchant can visit one of three markets: the Black
Market, Foreign Wares and the Fencer, in search of items for
the warband. Roll a D6 on the relevant table to see what
items are on offer.
Black Market
A den of thieves and underworld brigands the black markets of
Mordheim sell and procure all manner of illicit substances and are
regularly frequented by the infamous members of the Assassins
guild...
D6 Items
1 Nothing available.
2 Dark Venom or Black Lotus (D3 doses)
3 Crimson Shade (D3 doses)
4 Mandrake Root or Madcap Mushrooms (D3 doses)
5 Stiletto Blade (need ‘Weapons Training’ to use) +1 attack
per turn at -1 strength.
6 Blow Pipe (need ‘Weapons Training’ to use)

```
Foreign Wares
Traders from across the seas can be found in the shady taverns and
street corners on the outskirts of Mordheim. They have many exotic
and wondrous items for sale, but at a hefty price...
D6 Items
1 Nothing available.
2 Venom Ring
3 Lamp of the Djinn or Monkey’s Paw
4 Magic Carpet or Tufenk
5 Elven Cloak
6 Cathayan Silks
Fencer
Fencers have an eclectic range of items ‘procured’ from sources
best left unspoken. Offered at incredible prices, traders should be
wary for their word is not their bond and such items are often
‘flawed’...
D6 Items
1 Halfling Cook Book
2 Ithilmar Weapon
3 Gromril Weapon
4 Tome of Magic
5 Hunting Rifle or Elven Bow
6 Brace of Duelling Pistols
All the items purchased through the Merchant’s market
contacts are at their base price (i.e., do not add the random
gold modifier for items). All items bought from the Fencer
are also at half price but after the item is used once roll a D6.
On a roll of 1, the item breaks and is useless – an elaborate
fake!
Merchant Skills
Stone Cutter: The Merchant has the skill to refine wyrdstone
shards to increase their value. Whenever a warband sells its
wyrdstone the Merchant may try to refine the source. Roll a
D6 to discover how much additional gold the wyrdstone is
worth.
D6 Gold
1-2 Lose 2D6 gold crowns.
3-5 Gain 2D6 gold crowns.
6 Gain 3D6 gold crowns.
Guardian: The Merchant has ‘acquired’ a bodyguard to
protecting from harm in the coming battles. The bodyguard
will only protect the Merchant and cannot fulfil warband
objectives or search, loot or any function other than
protecting the Merchant and as such will remain within 1" of
the Merchant at all times. The bodyguard doesn’t gain
experience and isn’t paid (it is assumed he has been ‘gifted’
to the Merchant as a favour from one of his contacts).
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Bodyguard 4 4 2 4 3 1 3 1 8
Equipment: Sword, light armour, shield and helmet.
Special Rules
Intercept: the bodyguard will intercept any model shooting
at or charging the Merchant. Any attacks will be directed at
him and if charged place the bodyguard in front of the
Merchant to protect him. The bodyguard will not charge
unless the Merchant also charges and cannot intercept an
attack if already engaged in combat.

##### Barbarian

The Barbarians are massive men who are bred for battle from birth
and use their training to inflict pain and suffering on the enemies
that they consider to be weak and their prey, as well as rival tribes.
50 Gold Crowns +15 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Barbarian may be hired by any Lawful /
Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic, and Chaotic warbands
except for Skaven, Greenskins and Beastmen.
Rating: The Barbarian increases a warband's rating by 15
points plus 1 point for each Experience point the Barbarian
has.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Barbarian 4 4 2 5 3 2 3 3 6
Weapons/Armour: the Barbarian is armed with a dagger,
two-handed sword and wears a fur cloak (Act the same as a
wolfcloak)
Skills: The Barbarian may choose from Combat, Strength
and Speed when he gains a new skill.
Special Rules
Strongman: the barbarian starts with Strongman skill. See
the Strength Skills section of the rulebook for more details.

##### Bard

By Nick Kyme
In the dark and depressing streets of Mordheim a rousing tune
foretelling the warband's victory can lift even the lowliest of spirits.
A Bard may seem out of place in the City of the Damned but there
are those who are willing to sing out their battle chorus for the
highest bidder. These men are often warriors too, for only the
bravest of songsters would consider looking for an audience in
Mordheim.
20 Gold Crowns +10 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Bard may be hired by any Lawful,
Lawful / Neutral, and Neutral warbands.
Rating: A Bard increases a warband's rating by 8 points plus
1 point for each Experience point the Bard has.

Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Bard 4 3 3 3 3 1 3 1 7
Weapons/Armour: Sword, dagger and light armour.
Skills: The Bard may choose from Academic, Speed and
Musician when he gains a new skill.
Special Rules
Musician: The Bard starts with Musician skill. See the
common skills section of the rulebook for more details.
Songster: A Bard's rousing war songs steel the hearts of all
those around him. Any friendly model within 6" of a Bard
may re-roll any failed Leadership test with a +1 to
Leadership. This includes rout tests.

The streets of Mordheim crawl with the poor and destitute. They
scratch an existence by digging through the wreckage of this black
city for any meager supply of food. As such, these poor humans will
do just about anything for gold.
10 Gold Crowns +5 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Beggar may be hired by any warbands,
Though Neutral / Chaotic, and Chaotic warbands will have to
pay 15 gold crowns for their initial hire, as the Beggar knows
he may not survive the company long.
Rating: A Beggar increases a warband's rating by 8 points
plus 1 point for each Experience point Beggar has.

Beggar 4 1 1 2 2 1 3 1 5

Skills: The Beggar may choose from Speed when he gains a

Special Rules
Scrounge: Such is the Beggar's skill at scrounging through
the ruins of Mordheim, at the end of each battle that the
Beggar was not put out of action, he adds an extra die of
exploration to your pool.
Not a Threat: as a Beggar proves hardly a threat to any true
warrior, warbands may ignore Beggar for purposes of
shooting at the nearest target and charging another enemy
within 2” of the Beggar.

##### Black Orc

From the Nemesis Crown
Black Orcs are more independent than ordinary greenskins. They
were originally bred by the Chaos Dwarfs to eliminate the annoying
animosity which plagues their Orc and Goblin cousins.
Unfortunately the independence also made them difficult to control
and many left the land of the Chaos Dwarfs to pursue a life of
carnage of their own. Many join Orc waaghs where their strength
and skill is much admired. A few however wander alone and will
sell themselves for the opportunity to fight.
60 Gold Crowns +25 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Black Orc may be hired by any Neutral /
Chaotic, Chaotic warbands except for undead.
Rating: The Black Orc increases a warband's rating by 15
points plus 1 point for each Experience point the Black Orc
has.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Black Orc 4 4 3 4 4 1 2 1 7*
Weapons/Armour: The Black Orc wears Heavy armour and
has helmet. He may choose between two axes or a great Axe.
Skills: The Black Orc may choose from Combat & Strength
when he gains a new skill. In addition, the Black Orc may
choose from the Orc Special Skill list.
Special Rules
I said 'shut it'! (Only applicable for greenskin): Whilst the
Boss has this ferocious warrior in the warband the greenskins
are reluctant to make trouble. Any orcs or goblins within 6”
of the Black Orc do not suffer from the effects of Animosity.
The rest of the warband tests as normal.
Who's Da Boss!: If any Goblin leader is taken OOA during
the battle, the Black Orc HS steps up to replace him. For the
duration of the battle he gains the "Leader" ability. If the
Goblin leader gets the "Killed" result after the battle, then the
Black Orc decides to fill the new vacant position
permanently. The Black Orc becomes the new warband
leader, but he keeps his upkeep cost (hey, a Black Orc can't
live on mushrooms and fungus alone). The Black Orc does
not count towards the warband size when selling treasure.
Whose Da Man? (Only applicable for greenskin): A Black
Orc counts as a second leader in any warband he joins, and
relays orders (much nastier) to the other warriors. Warriors
within 6” of him may test off of their true leader’s Leadership
minus 1 if the leader is still on the table, or at the Black Orc’s
Leadership if he is not or if the Black Orc’s Leadership is
higher than their leader’s Leadership-1.
Independent: The Black Orc is fierce independence means
that they do not have to take All Alone tests.

##### Bounty Hunter

```
By Nick Kyme
Villains and outlaws are rife in the Old World. In Mordheim they
are as ubiquitous as the ruins that litter the streets. It is the false
perception of some outlaws that the depravity and chaos within the
city's walls can offer some anonymity from those men who would
seek to bring them to justice and claim the price on their heads. Not
so, for Bounty Hunters are determined and resourceful men who
will often hire themselves out as mercenaries to roaming warbands
in the hope of getting closer to their mark. Their mission is to
capture at all costs and a little thing like a cursed city isn't even
going to slow their stride...
40 Gold Crowns +15 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Bounty Hunter may be hired by any
Lawful, Lawful / Neutral and Neutral warbands.
Rating: A Bounty Hunter increases a warband's rating by 20

Weapons/Armour: Sword, dagger, pistol, crossbow, heavy
armour, helmet, rope hook and lantern.
Skills: The Bounty Hunter may choose from Combat,
Shooting, Strength and Speed when he gains a new skill.
Special Rules
Capture: The Bounty Hunter will always be on the lookout
for the outlaw he is pursuing. Such contracts are numerous,
especially in Mordheim so at the start of each battle nominate
one of your opponent's heroes as the Bounty Hunter's mark.
The Bounty Hunter gets a +1 to hit this model and must
always move towards them (if he can see them), unless he
can shoot (in which case choose). If the Bounty Hunter
successfully takes the hero 'out of action' he gains the hero's
gold value as payment (of which he gives the warband half)
+D3 experience if he survives the game and the Bounty
Hunter's side wins. After the battle do not roll on the serious
injury table for the hero, he simply counts as captured.

##### Duellist

```
By Nick Kyme
Duellists are men of the shadows, their reputations dark and
bloodthirsty. They are men of iron nerve who stare unflinchingly
into the face of death every time they draw their pistols. As well as
expert pistoliers, dualists are master swordsmen, their close quarter
fighting deadly and brief for their opponents. Those who seek the
services of a duellist must frequent dark avenues and taverns to
locate them, for they are enigmatic and elusive figures. However
any warband who secures their skills will reap great benefit.

##### Dwarf Runesmith Journeyman

From the Nemesis Crown
Having finished his apprenticeship it is usual for a Runesmith to
spend several years seeking to increase his knowledge of the art.
For some this may mean moving to another forge or hold and
working with a different master. Some however are fired to discover
things lost in the past and travel to old holds, looking for secrets
that have passed out of knowledge. Recovery of ancient Runes is
seen by most as a worthy exercise, unlike the pursuit of new
knowledge. For this reason a journeyman will accompany parties
seeking to right grudges and maintain their equipment in return for
protection on his expedition.
30 Gold Crowns +15 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Runesmith Journeyman may be hired by
any Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral warbands except for
Elven Warbands. Warbands that include Elven hired swords

crowns after each battle instead of 15 gold crowns. Dwarfs
won’t put up with weak pointy-eared folk unless they have to,

Special Rules
Runesmith: A Runesmith Journeyman may inscribe runes as
detailed below. In addition the Runesmith Journeyman may
learn a new rune instead on a new skill.
Armour: Dwarfs never suffer movement penalties for
wearing armour.
Armourer: A Runesmith can repair and make weapons and
armour. The warband may purchase one item per post game
trading session from the following: axes, hammers, swords,
two handed weapons, helmets, shields, light and heavy
armour at a 2d6GC discount to a minimum price of 1GC.
This applies only if the Runesmith did not go OOA.
Hate Orcs and Goblins: All Dwarfs hate Orcs and Goblins.
See the psychology section of the Mordheim rules for details
on the effects of hatred.
Hard Head: Dwarfs ignore the special rules for maces, clubs
etc. They are not very easy individuals to knock out.
Hard to Kill: Dwarfs are tough, resilient individuals who can
only be taken out of action on a D6 roll of 6 instead of 5-6
when rolling on the Injury chart. Treat a roll of 5 as stunned.

```
RUNE USE
A Runesmith may inscribe Runes before a battle; they start
knowing one Rune but may learn more as spell casters learn
spells. These Runes are only temporary due to the haste of
the Runesmith but may not be dispelled during the game.
Runes may be inscribed on axes, hammers, swords, two
handed weapons, helmets, shields, light and heavy armour.
The runes are:
Rune Effect Effective on Difficulty
Iron 6+ ward Armour 6
Stone +1 armour save Armour 6
Fury +1 A Weapon 7
Striking +1 WS Weapon 6
Speed +1 I Weapon 5
Cleaving +1 S Weapon 8
Before the battle the Runesmith may attempt to inscribe
every Rune he knows, but once only. No Rune may be
inscribed on an item with a Rune already on it. If he passes
the difficulty roll he has succeeded and the Rune will affect
the weapon/armour for the coming battle.
If he rolls a natural 2 the process has highlighted shoddy (and
hence non dwarf) manufacturing and the item being inscribed
on is broken, remove it from your roster.
A gromril item (including dwarf axes) may reroll a result of 2
but a second 2 stands. If he rolls a natural 12 the rune is
“durable” and will last beyond one battle else it fades after
the game.
Durable: If a Rune becomes durable roll a d6 after each
battle, but not the first, on a roll of 1 or 2 it fades and ceases
to be effective, otherwise it will be effective in the next
battle.

##### Dwarf Sapper

the Dwarf Sapper also wears Heavy Armour. The Dwarf
Sapper always has superior black powder for firearms.
Special Rules
Demolition Expert: Dwarf Sappers are legendary for their
ability to remove obstacles (for the right price). Secretly
nominate a piece of terrain before the battle, and write it
down. The Sapper can light the fuse from anywhere on the
battlefield at the start of either player's shooting phase. Roll a
D6 on the following chart:
D6 Result
1 = Fuse goes out near the target; Sapper must get within 8" to
re-light.
2 = Fuse goes out, try again next turn.
3-5 = Like clockwork, blows at the start of the next shooting
phase.
6 = Fast fuse. Building blows this turn.
When the building blows the terrain piece is levelled.
Remove it or replace it with craters and corner ruins. All
models on or inside the piece must pass an initiative test to
dive out of the way or suffer a D3 S5 hits. Models on the
second level or above must also take a falling test
Wanderer: The Dwarf Sapper is a wanderer, and will only
stay with a warband for the duration of a single battle. A
warband who used a Dwarf Sapper in their last battle may not
seek out another until they have fought at least one battle
without one.

##### Dwarf Slayer Pirate

By Tom Gabel
In the ancient Dwarf stronghold of Barak-Varr is a great trade
center, and many Dwarf merchant ships make port in its harbors.
The crew of these ships are some of the most cunning and skilled
sailors in the old world. It is their charge not only to man the ships
but also to protect the precious cargo of those ships, often rare
Dwarven ales and treasures.
Should one of these shipments be lost, whether captured, wrecked,
or lost to the depths of the sea, a great dishonour is placed on both
captain and crew of the ship. This shame is often too much to bear,

```
and occasionally such a Dwarf seaman will undertake the Slayer
Oath, but will retain his old habits and combat preferences to those
of the traditional Troll Slayers.
The Slayer Pirate “hired guns” will often turn to the city of the
damned to seek out an honourable death in combat.
30 Gold Crowns +15 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Dwarf Slayer Pirate may be hired by any
Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, or Neutral warbands except for
Elven Warbands. Warbands that include Elven hired swords

Special Rules
Deathwish. Dwarf Slayer Pirates seek an honourable death in
combat. They are completely immune to all psychology and
will never need to test if they are fighting alone.
Hard Head. Dwarf Slayer Pirates ignore the special rules for
maces, clubs etc. They are not very easy individuals to knock
out!
Hard to Kill. Dwarf Slayer Pirates are tough, resilient
individuals who can only be taken out of action on a D6 roll
of 6 instead of 5-6 when rolling on the Injury chart. Treat a
roll of 5 as stunned.
Festooned with Pistols: Dwarf Slayer Pirates carry so many
pistols into battle that they never have to reload, they always
have a new pistol primed and ready to fire. The only
exception is hand-to-hand combat. The Slayer Pirate will not
have time to draw a new pistol every round of hand-to-hand
combat, he may only use pistols in the first round. In
subsequent rounds of hand-to-hand combat the pistol should
be counted as a club. He may draw another pistol once he is
out of combat or all of his opponents are knocked down or
stunned.
Raging Drunk: The combination of being a Dwarf and
spending the better part of life on the sea means Slayer
Pirates usually know where to acquire some fine Dwarven

as Rare 6, but must pay an extra 2D6 gold crowns to
compensate for the copious amounts of ale that the Slayer
Pirate will consume.

##### Dwarf Treasure Hunter

By Jake Thornton
Dwarfs are famed for their love of gold, ale, and adventure, not
necessarily in that order. Since the disaster at Mordheim they have
come to the ruins in ever-increasing numbers, some seeking riches,
but many just after a good fight. They’re well known as tough
warriors and are very much sought after as hired muscle by other
warbands, but the Treasure Hunters have other benefits too. Dwarf
Treasure Hunters are specialists in finding riches that other people
have tried to hide and, as such, can add considerably to a
warband’s purse.
55 Gold Crowns +30 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Dwarf Treasure Hunter may be hired by
any Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, or Neutral warbands except for
Elven or Dwarf Treasure Hunter Warbands. Warbands that
include Elven hired swords may hire Slayers, but must pay
40 gold crowns after each battle instead of 30 gold crowns.
Dwarfs won’t put up with weak pointy-eared folk unless they
have to, or are adequately compensated for their sufferance.
Rating: A Dwarf Treasure Hunter increases a warband's
rating by 24 points plus 1 point for each Experience point
Dwarf Treasure Hunter has.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Treasure Hunter 3 5 4 3 4 1 2 1 9
Weapons/Armour: Gromril armour, helmet, mining pick
(great weapon), dagger, hammer, treasure maps, and lantern.
Skills: The Dwarf Treasure Hunter may choose from
Combat, & Strength when he gains a new skill. In addition,
the Dwarf Treasure Hunter may choose from the Dwarf
Special Skill list.
Special Rules
Hate Orcs and Goblins: All Dwarfs hate Orcs and Goblins.
See the psychology section of the Mordheim rules for details
on the effects of hatred.
Hard Head: Dwarfs ignore the special rules for maces, clubs
etc. They are not very easy individuals to knock out.
Hard to Kill: Dwarfs are tough, resilient individuals who can
only be taken out of action on a D6 roll of 6 instead of 5-6
when rolling on the Injury chart. Treat a roll of 5 as stunned.
Treasure Maps: Over his time in the ruins, the Treasure
Hunter has acquired a number of treasure maps. Call it greed
if you must, professional interest if you're more polite. Some
of these are obvious fakes, but there are many that seem
promising. At least, on first glance. Each battle the Dwarf
Treasure Hunter will choose one map and see where it leads.

```
Roll a D6 at the end of each battle which the Dwarf Treasure
Hunter survives without going out of action.
1 Ambush!: The Dwarf Treasure Hunter is ambushed by D3
brigands who planted the fake map to lure the unwary to their
doom. Immediately fight a close combat between the brigands
and the Treasure Hunter with the brigands going first and
counting as charging. The Brigands have the stats of a Human
Mercenary Warrior and are armed with a club and dagger.
2 Poor Fake: It quickly becomes obvious that this is a feeble
forgery and is utterly worthless. The Treasure Hunter uses it to
light his pipe.
3 Looted Hoard: It was a good map, but someone beat you to it!
Mind you, there's enough left to add +1 to the number of shards
collected by your warband this game.
4 Cellar: When Dwarfs say “treasure”, they don't always mean
gold. This map leads to a forgotten cellar of a ruined pub and
contains a small barrel of Bugman's finest ale – treasure indeed!
This works like the one in the rules, but there's only enough to
give to D6 warriors. Decide when you want them to drink it and
roll to see how many it'll go round. The first warrior to drink
from the barrel must be the Dwarf Treasure Hunter himself. The
barrel cannot be sold, and if the Treasure Hunter is not retained
he'll manage to take this with him when he goes.
5 Real Treasure Map: Roll one extra Exploration dice.
6 Jackpot!: You get one extra Exploration dice. However, do not
roll this along with the rest of them. Instead, roll the Exploration
dice you'd normally be entitled to first. Then choose the result of
the extra dice instead of rolling it (potentially making doubles
into triples, etc). Once you've done this, resolve the results of the
exploration as normal. Note that these results are not
cumulative. The Treasure Hunter consults a different map each
battle, and so the results only apply to that battle (or, more
accurately, to the actions between that battle and the next).

##### Dwarf Troll Slayer

Troll Slayers are members of the morbid Dwarf cult whose followers
are obsessed with seeking an honourable death in combat. Having
committed some unforgivable crime or been dishonoured in an
irredeemable way, a Dwarf will forsake his home and wander off to
die fighting the enemies of Dwarfkind.
Troll Slayers are insanely dangerous individuals, psychopathic and
violent. However, there are few better fighters, so they are much
sought after when warriors are needed.
Known as ‘Hired Axes’, Troll Slayers who come to Mordheim find
plenty of opportunity to indulge their deathwish.
25 Gold Crowns +10 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Dwarf Troll Slayer may be hired by any
Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, and Neutral warbands except for
Elven Warbands. Warbands that include Elven hired swords
may hire Slayers, but must pay 20 gold crowns after each
battle instead of 10 gold crowns. Dwarfs won’t put up with
weak pointy-eared folk unless they have to, or are adequately
compensated for their sufferance.
Rating: A Dwarf troll slayer increases a warband's rating by
12 points plus 1 point for each Experience point the Dwarf
troll slayer has.

Special Rules
Deathwish. Troll Slayers seek an honourable death in
combat. They are completely immune to all psychology and
will never need to test if they are fighting alone.
Hard Head. Troll Slayers ignore the special rules for maces,
clubs etc. They are not very easy individuals to knock out!
Hard to Kill. Troll Slayers are tough, resilient individuals
who can only be taken out of action on a D6 roll of 6 instead
of 5-6 when rolling on the Injury chart. Treat a roll of 5 as
stunned.

##### Elf Mage

```
By Jake Thornton
Unlike the staid and traditionally insular archmages of the Tower of
Saphery, devotees of the smaller Djed’hi temple are wanderers.
After a brief few decades study at the temple on Ulthuan, they leave
to seek enlightenment in the true ways of magic by studying the ways
of the world. There is no single path to this enlightenment, indeed
there are said to be more paths than there are those that tread them.
The Djed’hi are not merely students of the academic arts. Their
wanderings are perilous and inevitably lead them into dangerous
lands where they must defend themselves. Thus, most of their magics
are means to enable them to survive to explore the world another
day.
Few of the Djed’hi own much in the way of possessions, and this
saves them from some of the less savoury folk they encounter.
However, although robbing them is generally not worth the effort,
the mere fact that they are Elves is enough to attract bigots and
small-minded fools to attack them. All this just underlines the
natural feelings of superiority of the wanderers, which in turn makes
their enlightenment all the more distant.
45 Gold Crowns
May be Hired: The Elf Mage may be hired by any Lawful,

Fey: Hostile magic spells will not affect the Elf on a D6 roll
of a 4+.
Sorcery: The Elf Mage Counts as having the skill Sorcery
See the Academic Skills section of the rulebook for more
details.
Wanderer: An Elf Mage is a wanderer, and will only stay
with a warband for the duration of a single battle. A warband
who used an Elf Mage in their last battle may not seek out
another until they have fought at least one battle without one.
Magic User: The Elf Mages has the ability to use magic and
casts spells like any other magicians, and the Elf Mages starts
with three spells generated at random from the Spells of the
Djed’hi list. See the Magic section for details.

##### Expert Marksman

By Mark Havener
The Empire is not the only place that breeds mercenaries. The
constant warring among the city-states of Tilea provides many
opportunities for a man who knows how to use a weapon. Still,
sometimes the fighting dies down in Tilea and many of these
mercenaries are forced to seek employment in other lands. Many of
these temporarily unemployed mercenaries have heard of the
trouble brewing in Mordheim and have come seeking a new patron.
30 Gold Crowns +15 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Expert Marksman may be hired by any
warbands except for Beastmen, Greenskins, Skaven or
Undead warbands.
Rating: An Expert Marksman increases a warband's rating

modifiers for cover when shooting his crossbow.
Steady Hands: The Expert Marksman’s aim never wavers.
He ignores ‘to hit’ modifiers for long range when shooting
his crossbow.

##### Freelancer

Just as warriors of the lower social orders can become mercenaries,
squires or nobles may offer their skills for hire by becoming a
Freelancer or ‘robber knight’. Freelancers are often the younger
sons of nobles, who have inherited little but their weapons, horse
and armour. Having become disillusioned with their lot in life they
have taken the only road available to them: that of a Hired Sword.
Financial considerations take precedence over the dictates of
honour and chivalry. Many Freelancers have drifted to the shanty
towns surrounding Mordheim, and offer their considerable strength
to the highest bidders.
50 Gold Crowns +20 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Freelancer may be hired by any Lawful,

has an armour saving throw of 3+, on foot his save is 4+.

and Cavalry when he gains a new skill.
Special Rules
Ride (Warhorse): See the Common Skills section of the

##### Goblin Lantern Bearer

```
By Dennis Montera
It's tough being a goblin, especially if you feel you have talent. The
orcs don't take you seriously, the other goblins are always starting
fights, and there is the continual threat of being fed to the trolls.
Occasionally, a smart goblin will go off and try to earn a living. If
he is lucky, he might actually survive for a while. Freelance goblins
have found many jobs around Mordheim. Of most use to the many
warbands of Mordheim are goblin lantern bearers. For a very small
fee, the hired goblin will carry a lantern around the ruins of
Mordheim and try to find those pesky hidden enemies.
15 Gold Crowns +5 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Goblin Lantern Bearer may be hired by
Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic, Chaotic
warbands except for Dwarven, Elven & Greenskins.
Rating: The Goblin Lantern Bearer increases a warband's
rating by 5 points plus 1 point for each Experience point the
Goblin Lantern Bearer has.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Goblin Lantern Bearer 4 2 3 3 3 1 4 1 5
Weapons/Armour: The Goblin Lantern Bearer is armed
with Dagger and Lantern
Skills: The Goblin Lantern Bearer may choose from Speed
when he gains a new skill.
Special Rules
Smart (for a goblin): The Goblin Lantern Bearer has
survived partially on his brains. Being one of the smarter
from the litter, he does not suffer from animosity as most
goblins do.
Very Lucky: The Goblin Lantern Bearer has survived for
some time by his luck. If the goblin is taken out of action
during the game, roll for his injuries with the following
results: 1 – Lost, 2-6 – Survives.
Small Size: Due to their small size, Goblin Lantern Bearers
can fit into very small spaces. If the goblin is not taken out of
action during the fight, then they can help in the search for
wyrdstone. When rolling for wyrdstone, roll dice as normal
for the warband. The Goblin Lantern Bearer adds +3 to the
total dice roll when determining the number of shards found
(i.e. if the dice total is 15, then add +3 for a total of 18, and
thus 4 shards found instead of 3).

##### Halfling Scout

Halflings are diminutive creatures, generally more concerned with
the timing of their next meal (or two) than with military pursuits.
They range from three to four feet tall, and are neither very strong
nor tough, but are naturally good shots and steadfast in the face of
danger. Some Halflings are more adventurous than others, however,
and these bold spirits are much sought after by mercenary bands,
for they are splendid archers, and excellent cooks to boot.
15 Gold Crowns +5 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Halfling Scout may be hired by any
Lawful, Lawful / Neutral and Neutral warbands.
Rating: A Halfling Scout increases a warband's rating by 5
points plus 1 point for each Experience point the Halfling
Scout has.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Halfling Scout 4 2 4 2 2 1 4 1 8

Skills: The Halfling Scout may choose from Shooting and
Speed when he gains a new skill. In addition, the Halfling
Scout may choose from the Halfling Special Skill list.
Special Rules
Cook: Halflings are renowned for their cooking skills. A
warband with a Halfling Scout may increase its maximum
size by +1, as warriors from all around are attracted by the
smell of great food! Note that this does not increase the
maximum number of Heroes you may have.

##### Halfling Thief

```
By Mark Havenor
Halflings are well known for their nimble feet and even nimbler
fingers. While many follow their fathers and turn their dexterous
skills to works of craft such as basket making, cobbling, and cooking
(in fact, a lot of cooking), many also find themselves drawn towards
the danger and excitement of stealing. Of course, Halflings never
take anything too valuable (except by accident), as that would not be
nice to the person who previously owned the item. Nonetheless, it is
surprising the number of things that go ‘missing’ when a Halfling is
about. The poor little chaps don’t know they’re doing it half the
time, they just seem to acquire rings, boxes of matches, and small
pets as they go about their normal business.
25 Gold Crowns + Special upkeep
May be Hired: The Halfling Thief may be hired by any
Lawful / Neutral, or Neutral warbands.
Rating: A Halfling Thief increases a warband's rating by 14

Speed when he gains a new skill. In addition, the Halfling
Thief may choose from the Halfling Special Skill list.
Special Rules
Infiltrator: The Thief may be placed on the battlefield after
the opposing warbands so long as he is out of sight and 12”
from all enemies. If multiple models may infiltrate, roll off to
see who places first.
Cutpurse: If the thief took part in the game and was not
taken out of action, the warband may collect an extra
Wyrdstone.
Uneasy Ally: At the end of the game roll a D6.
D6 Result
1 Stop Thief! Unimpressed with his employment, the
Thief leaves the warband immediately, taking all the
warband’s previously hoarded Wyrdstone, gold, and
items from the stash. However, exploration for this
battle may proceed as normal.
2-5 Tax Time: The Thief costs 15 gc upkeep.
6 Ignorance is Bliss: The Thief costs no upkeep as he has
helped himself. On the bright side, whatever it is he’s
filched the warband never knew it had.

##### Highwayman

Roaming the woods and secluded byways of the Empire,
highwaymen prey on the many coaches and wagons foolish or
desperate enough to travel there. These are dark and dangerous
men, often employed for their knowledge of cargo charters and skill
at ambush. Oft they appear to the naked eye, bereft of their
blackened garb, as foppish, charming characters, but that ruse is a
genteel masquerade as their cruelty and viciousness will testify.
Deadly pistoliers and expert riders, they are an asset to any
warband but watch your back, for they are untrustworthy, self-
serving men.
35 Gold Crowns +20 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Highwayman may be hired by any
Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic, and Chaotic warbands. A
Highwayman will never join a warband that also contains a
Road warden.

Highwayman 4 3 4 3 3 1 3 1 7
Horse 8 0 0 3 3 1 3 0 5
Weapons/Armour: Dagger, Brace of pistols, rapier and a
cloak (acts as a buckler in close combat). If you are using the
optional rules for mounted models then the Highwayman also
rides a horse. When the Highwayman is mounted, he has a
save of 6+, on foot he has no Armour save.
Skills: The Highwayman may choose from Combat,
Shooting, Speed and Cavalry when he gains a new skill.
Special Rules
Ride (Horse): See the Common Skills section of the
rulebook for more details.
Expert Pistolier: A Highwayman’s skill with a brace of
pistols is unrivalled and as such he combines the effects of
the skills Pistolier and Trick Shooter.
Expert Rider: A Highwayman is a superb rider and as such
while he is mounted he counts as being stationary for the
purposes of shooting (i.e.. no -1 modifier to hit) and he also
benefits from the skill as he can reload quickly whilst on
horseback.
Unscrupulous: A Highwayman, despite all his skill and
bravado, is not to be trusted. At the end of each battle roll a
D6, on a roll of a 1 the warband receives 1 less piece of
Treasure than they would normally as the Highwayman has
stolen it for himself (this Treasure is not spent on the
Highwayman, it is lost!). Obviously, if this keeps happening
it will be up to warband leader to keep the Highwayman in
his employ or not...
Stagecoaches: Both Highwaymen and Road wardens are
particularly suited to battles involving stagecoaches, wagons,
etc. To represent this, in any scenario in which one or both
sides have a stagecoach or a wagon, any Highwayman or
Road warden in either warband may re-roll a single dice roll
once per turn. This special bonus lasts until the re-rolled dice
comes up as a 1 as it is designed to represent their ability to
predict and perform at their peak in familiar and well-
practiced territory.

##### Hochland Huntsmaster

```
By Philip Greig
Hunters in the lands of Hochland are renowned for their skills.
Coupled with their deadly long rifles, they can shoot down targets at
up to 300 feet. Hochland Huntsmasters are experienced veterans
that have come to Mordheim to hunt the best prey of all, humans,
and whatever strange monsters that are brewing in the Pit.
70 Gold Crowns +30 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Hochland Huntsmaster may be hired by

Weapons/Armour: the Hochland Huntsmaster is armed with
Hochland long rifle and a hunting knife that counts as a

Skills: The Hochland Huntsmaster may choose from
Shooting and Speed when he gains a new skill.
Special Rules
Excellent Sight: Trained to spot the stealthiest of prey, the
Hochland Huntsmaster spots Hidden enemies from two times
as far as other warriors (i.e., twice his Initiative value in
inches).
Independent: Hochland Hunters work alone and their fierce
independence means that they do not have to take All Alone
tests.
Sniper: A Hochland Huntsmaster is not deployed at the
beginning of the game. He is deployed at the beginning of the
second turn of play within 16" of the player's table edge. He
is considered Hidden after deployment. This represents the
Huntsmaster spending the entire first turn looking for a good
sniping position.

##### Imperial Assassin

By Mark Havener
Politics is a dangerous game and not all dangers are found on the
battlefield. The Assassin specializes in removing ‘obstacles’ with
discretion. He will hire himself out to the highest bidder and
satisfaction is guaranteed. The Assassin calmly dispatches his
rather distasteful duties with fastidiousness and finesse. In between
jobs, such a man will often join a wandering warband in order to
hone his skills; assassination is not a profession for the slow or dull-
witted!
40 Gold Crowns +20 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Imperial Assassin may be hired by any
Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic, and Chaotic
warbands except for Dwarven, Elven, Greenskins and Skaven

Skills: The Imperial Assassin may choose from Combat,
Shooting Speed and Unstoppable Charge from the Strength
skills when he gains a new skill. In addition, the Imperial
Assassin may choose from the Assassin Special Skill list.
Special Rules
Poisoner: Assassins specialize in the use of poisons. The
Assassin starts each game with his weapons poisoned with
either Black Lotus or Dark Venom. The controlling player
decides which poison the Assassin is armed with before the
game starts, and this poison does not need to be traded for.
And no, the Assassin cannot poison other warband members’
weapons, nor will he loan his out!
Weapons Master: The Assassin is a master of weapons and
may use any weapon he finds. You may purchase weapons
for the Assassin just as you would for any other member of
your warband. However, unlike other members of your
warband, any weapon you give an Assassin is his to keep –
he will not give it to another warband member later. In
addition, although he knows how to use them, an Assassin
will never use a blackpowder weapon as such devices are far
too conspicuous in their use for someone in his profession.

##### Imperial Tactician

```
By Daniel Logee
The Empire is famed for its superior generals and expert field
commanders. When not in war, these same tacticians can be found
all across the Empire, honing their skill through skirmish, border
patrols, and even leading, or aiding warbands in the ruins of
Mordheim.

Skills: The Imperial Tactician may choose from Combat &
Strength, when he gains a new skill. In addition, an Imperial
Tactician may also choose from the following skills below.
Special Rules
Expert Tactician: at the start of the game, after all warbands
have been deployed, the Imperial Tactician may then
recommend up to D3+1 changes to your deployment (IE, you
may change the starting position of up to D3+1 of your
warriors.)
Read the Battle: as the Imperial Tactician has an eye for
reading how any battle is going, he knows when a cause is
lost or not. As long as the Imperial Tactician is not out of
action, the hiring warband automatically passes the first rout
test they are required to make.
Imperial Tactician Skills
Organized Search Party: The warband may re-roll one exploration
die.
Send False Signals: by misleading the opposing warband(s), an
Imperial Tactician can make them deploy their forces in a way
beneficial to his own warband. Thus, after all warbands have
deployed (but before the hiring player has used the Expert Tactician
ability), the player controlling the Imperial Tactician may move 1
member from each opposing warband D6” in any direction. This
move may not move a warband member off the board, nor may it
place a member of the warband in direct harm (you can't force a
warrior to jump off a building!).

##### Kislev Ranger

By Nick Kyme
Kislev is a wild and untamed land; a place of endless horizons,
rocky steppes, and icy tundra, its plains stretch as far as the eye can
see. It is here that the rangers are in their element. Capable of great
endurance, traveling on foot for days at a time, they negotiate this
hostile land, patrolling its borders, ever watchful for dark forces.
As Mordheim, the City of the Damned, draws sell-swords and
fortune-hunters from across the Old World it is no surprise to find
Kislevite Rangers there too. Adept at exploring through the ruins,
finding forgotten loot or lending their deadly aim to a captain’s
ambition, warbands frequently hire these wild warriors.
Perhaps most peculiar of all is that most of the rangers are women.
The men folk of the northern lands are committed to its protection
from the ravaging armies of the Kurgan marauder hordes and the
other servants of Chaos. It is the women then, often those shunned
by their families or banished for some misdeed, that range out from
their homes, perhaps hoping to redeem themselves or even make
their own fortunes in the perilous lands beyond.

rolls 6 to hit followed by 5+ to wound, the target is
automatically out of action, regardless of wounds, with no
save whatsoever.
Hunter’s Cloak: The Ranger’s cloak allows her to shoot
while hidden. The target may try to spot the hidden Ranger
with an Initiative test if it survives.
Loner: Ranger’s are immune to All Alone tests.
Seeker: If the Ranger did not go out of action, she may
modify one Exploration die by +/-1.

##### Mule Skinner

```
Mule Skinners are quite common wherever teams of animal are
used. They are experienced warriors, accustomed to handling teams
of draft and pack animals such as horses and (strangely enough)
mules as well as more exotic animals such as Cold Ones. Most are
freelance, offering their services in the marketplace alongside
traditional traders. They are widely travelled and have contacts in
most major cities, especially among the animal merchants.

##### Ogre Bodyguard

Ogres are large, brutish creatures, standing some ten feet tall, and
all of it bone and muscle. For this reason they are much in demand
as bodyguards and mercenaries, despite their lack of brains. A
warband backed up by an Ogre makes a fearsome enemy, since
Ogres are extremely dangerous fighters and a terrifying sight to
behold when enraged. They happily accept any employer, as they
are notoriously unbothered about who they fight for.

##### Ogre Slave Master

```
By Ross Franks
As of men, Ogre's too have fallen to the dark and corrupt ways of
evil. Certain ruthless Ogre's have been recruited by the darker,
sinister warbands lurking around Mordheim. They have one
purpose, to capture others and force them to fight in their warbands.
It's a cheaper alternative to forking out the hard earned gold coins
for a low life hireling, and with scarce volunteers joining up with
the evil warbands, who wouldn't hire an Ogre Slave Master?
90 Gold Crowns +35 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Ogre Slave Master may be hired by any
chaotic warbands.
Rating: The Ogre Slave Master increases a warband's rating
by 40 points plus 1 point for each Experience point the Ogre
Slave Master has.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Ogre Slave Master 6 3 2 4 4 3 4 2 7
Weapons/Armour: The Ogre Slave Master is armed with an
axe, a club, and light armour.
Skills: The Ogre Slave Master may choose from Combat and
Strength when he gains a new skill.
Special Rules
Capture: The Slave Master will always be on the lookout for
new slaves for him to capture. Such contracts are numerous,
especially in Mordheim so at the start of each battle nominate
one of your opponent's heroes as the Slave Master 's mark.
The Slave Master gets a +1 to hit this model and must always
move towards them (if he can see them. If the Slave Master
successfully takes the hero 'out of action' he gains +D3
experience if he survives the game and the Slave Master 's
side wins. After the battle do not roll on the serious injury
table for the hero, he simply counts as captured.
If the Slave Master is taken OOA in a battle and none of the
Slave Master's warband members are within 8" of the "mark",
then the "mark" will automatically run for the nearest safe
area (whether that's off the board, in which case it disappears
forever, or towards its original warband). If the mark ever
comes within 8" of its original warband, then it automatically
is controlled by the original owner of the "mark".
If the Slave Master is taken OOA in a battle and the mark is
within 8" of another figure from the Slave Master's warband,
the "mark" will charge this closest model of that warband
automatically in rage (treat as having hatred).
Fear: Ogres are large, threatening creatures that cause fear.
See the Psychology section for details.
Large Target: Ogres are Large Targets as defined in the
shooting rules.

##### Pit Fighter

Pit Fighters are dangerous men who make their living in the illegal
fighting pits of the Empire. Many of them are slaves and prisoners
but some are free men who earn their living from savage pit fights in
settlements like Cutthroat’s Haven or Black Pit. Even though pit
fights are banned in many provinces, they are very popular and a
great deal of money is wagered on the outcome. Thus many
authorities turn a blind eye to these bloodsports.
When not in the pits, Pit Fighters offer their services to the
highest bidders, and they readily find employment in
warbands intent on exploring the ruins of Mordheim. Pit
Fighters are powerful and dangerous fighters, and their
unique weaponry gives them an advantage against almost
any opponent.

##### Priest of Morr

```
By Todd Estabrook (legion@ennui.net)
"Although we offer blessings upon a departing soul, that Morr may
allow it passage through the realm of death, the soul is not our
concern. The soul belongs to Morr. Our concern is the body. Our
rituals insure that the body remains just as it is; that it is properly
sealed and sanctified, lest something enter into the cadaver's shell
and corrupt it... or worse."
Morr is the name given to the God of Death, and his priests are
representatives of a greater power just as are Warrior Priests and
Matriarchs of Sigmar. The priests of Morr are concerned with the
care of the dead and the calming of restless souls. They are great
enemies of Undead, and dont seek to bring people to a premature
end. Some have been drawn to Mordheim by the spiritual
disturbance caused by so many deaths in one place at one time when
the Hammer of Sigmar struck. They desire to travel into the city to
lay restless souls to ease and to investigate rumors of Undead
activity. They often join larger groups of humans adventuring into
the city, trading thier influence with thier god for mutual protection.
Thier cost and upkeep reflects supplies used by the priest for the
proper burial of the dead. The priests of Morr are able to call upon
the favor of thier god in the form of prayers like the Sigmarite
priests and priestesses. Thier abilities do not count as magic, and
any protections against magic do not apply versus them.
Dressed in the plain black robes of their faith, the priests of Morr
have come to Mordheim to insure the souls of those who have died
safe passage and, more importantly, that the dead remain as such.
20 Gold Crowns +10 Gold Crowns upkeep
May be Hired: The Priest of Morr may be hired by any
Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral warbands except for

Morr may choose randomly determine a new pray from the
Funerary Rite spell list.
Special Rules
Loner: Few people care to spend any length of time in the
company of a Priest of Morr – even when it is their duty to do
so. As such, a Priest of Morr is used to being alone and
probably prefers it that way. Priests of Morr do not take all
alone tests.
Pray User: The Priest of Morr is a servant of Morr and may
use the Funerary Rites as detailed in the Magic section and
the Priest of Morr start with two prays generated at random.
See the Magic section for details. In addition the Priest of
Morr may learn a new Pray instead on a new skill.
Save the Dead: The Priest hates all models that can cast
necromantic magic. Furthermore, he will not require upkeep
after a battle against warbands containing any undead.

##### Priest of Ranald

By Peter Long (wanderingblade@hotmail.com)
Ranald is the god of thieves, gamblers and non-violent criminals. To
Ranald, violence is the fools option, the last option. Like all gods in
the Empire, Ranald has his clergy, who being representatives of a
higher power, have the same ability to call upon prayers to manifest
and help them. The priesthood of Ranald has heard about the
tragedy of Mordheim, and feel they need more information. They
have sent wandering priests to look for information, under the
pretext of recovering relics. While there, to supplement their
income, they often hire themselves out to warbands; dispite their
dislike of violence, they are never the less handy individuals.

##### Road Warden

Patrolling the fraught and dangerous highways of the Empire, Road
wardens are dour men of the sternest courage. Solitary figures, they
range far and wide, often with little food and in all weathers. They
are hardened and brutal fighters, uncompromising and without any
martial code, they give no quarter as they expect none to be given in
return. Their skill lies with the crossbow, with which they are
excellent hunters and deadly marksmen. Highwaymen, deviants and
bandits are their common quarry, safety of the roadways their
charge and they execute both with deliberate and unswerving
severity.
40 Gold Crowns +20 Gold Crowns upkeep

Stern: Working alone and in the dark for the majority of his
profession the Road warden is made of strong stuff indeed.
He may re-roll any failed Leadership test for panic, fear, and
is immune to the rules for being All Alone.
Stagecoaches: Both Highwaymen and Road wardens are
particularly suited to battles involving stagecoaches, wagons,
etc. To represent this, in any scenario in which one or both
sides have a stagecoach or a wagon, any Highwayman or
Road warden in either warband may re-roll a single dice roll
once per turn. This special bonus lasts until the re-rolled dice
comes up as a 1 as it is designed to represent their ability to
predict and perform at their peak in familiar and well-
practiced territory.

##### Shadow Warrior

```
Shadow Warriors are High Elves from the desolate war-ravaged
land of Nagarythe, where the Witch King once held court. This leads
their kin to mistrust and ostracise them. These angry lost souls are
often used as scouts and skirmishers for High Elf forces, as well as
wandering sell-swords looking to quench their bitter hatred of the
Dark Elves. Though not as skilled a scout as the Ranger, the
Shadow Warrior is as deadly with his bow and sword as any Elf.

Thief’s Cloak: Thieves wear cloaks that help them blend in

items! A Thief may attempt to steal one item during the
Trading phase. Choose any item, if it is a common item the
Thief successfully steals it on a 2+ on a D6. A Rare item is
successfully stolen by rolling higher than the availability
number on 2D6. Any items stolen may be used in exactly the
same way as one that was bought. If the Thief fails to steal
the item roll a D6. On a score of 1-5 the thief is chased out of
the trading post and escapes. On the score of a 6 the Thief is
captured by whatever authorities there may be and is hung
(remove him from the warband roster).

##### Warlock

```
Wizards, shamans, mystics, all these and more are associated with
men who can wield the power of magic. All magic is potentially
dangerous and originates from Chaos, so those blessed (or cursed)
with the power of sorcery are hated and feared. Still, it is not
difficult to find employment if you are a wizard, for many are willing
to take the risk of persecution. But hiring a Warlock does not only
mean that you lose your gold – if the teachings of the Cult of Sigmar

##### Witch

By Nick Kyme
There are those practitioners of magic that dwell permanently within the depraved ruins of Mordheim. They are unable to find a place in
society and live as hermits, conjuring their magicks in utter solitude. These creatures are witches and are often seen in the broken down
houses and ruined shacks that litter the City of the Damned, stooped over bubbling cauldrons, sheltering from the rain. They are ancient and
individual practitioners of magic, using many old spells, and methods that are older still. It is a lucky warband that can find and employ the
services of a witch for they are reclusive and solitary individuals but can be swayed when the price or purpose suits them.

```
Potions: The Witch is an expert as brewing all manner of
curious concoctions. A single hero in the warband who have
hired the Witch may partake of such a potion before the
battle. Roll a D6 to discover the draught's effect.
1 Debilitating: The potion is simply too potent for the hero
and weakens them. They are at -1 Toughness for the whole
of the next battle until they can roll a 6 on a D6 in the
recovery phase to shrug off the ill effects.
2-3 Strength: The hero is infused with strength as he quaffs the
potion. He is at +1 Strength until he rolls a 1 on a D6 in the
recovery phase.
4-5 Resilience: An inner resilience passes through the hero. He
is at +1 to Toughness until he rolls a 1 on a D6 in the
recovery phase.
6 Fortitude: The hero's constitution is increased and he feels
ready to take anyone on. He gains an extra wound for the
whole battle. However, once lost the wound cannot be
restored.
Recluse: Witches are very reclusive individuals and therefore
difficult to employ. Even when they are found they may be
reluctant to aid the warband no matter how much gold they
offer. When attempting to hire a Witch the warband leader
must roll a D6. If he or she can score a 4+ the Witch can be
hired, otherwise the Witch shuns them and they will have to
try again after their next battle.
Reluctant: Whilst she is happy to use her magic to aid the
warband, the Witch is reluctant to enter the fray herself. As
such the Witch will never charge (although if charged she
will defend herself) and will always try to stay at least 8"
away from enemy models and must move away if she finds
herself within this distance.
```
##### Witch Hunter

From the Nemesis Crown
Witch Hunters are driven men who make it their job to free the
Empire of the taint of chaos. Although these troubled times have
often meant witch hunters operating in small groups or by
requisitioning support from local authorities many still prefer to
work alone. Some of course have other reasons, their excessive zeal
can lead to other hunters shunning them or even their expulsion
from the order, in a few cases they themselves have darker secrets
they don’t want their brothers in arms investigating. These solitary
witch hunters are not above joining roving bands if it suits their
aims, providing they are reimbursed for the skills they bring. They
care little for the morals of such groups providing that they are a
human band and not tainted in any way by chaos. The threat of
chaos is so great that they have even put aside their prejudices
against followers of Ulric to better fight chaos.

Sigmar’s reward: Doing Sigmar’s work is reward enough at
times. If the band take the leader of a chaos or undead band
out of action the Witch Hunter waives part of his fee, at the
end of the battle he only charges 5gc upkeep. Chaotic bands
only includes bands truly chaotic, not merely nonhuman, e.g.
not skaven, dark elves etc.

##### Wood Elf Ranger

```
Elves are a wondrous race: lithe, tall, beautiful, long lived and
magical. For the most part they are feared and distrusted by
humans, though some live in the cities amongst men and offer their
services as minstrels and archers in return for a high fee. Though
Elves become rarer in the Old World each year, there are still some
roaming on the trackless paths of the Drakwald Forest and the
Forest of Shadows.
Elves sensibly tend to avoid the ruins of Mordheim, for in the City of
the Damned there is little to attract that fey and strange race, but
sometimes they are hired by treasure hunters, for few can match
their skill with a bow, or their inhuman quickness and agility. The
senses of an Elf are much keener than any human’s, and they make

### Dramatis Personae

This section details some of the strangest and most famous
(or infamous) characters to be found in Mordheim and the
outlying settlements. Occasionally, these warriors join forces
with a warband (usually demanding wyrdstone or a bag of
gold in payment).
The following characters (known as ‘special characters’) are
hard to find and expensive to hire – you must be lucky and
wealthy to attract their attention.
This list does not, by any means, include all the famous
warriors and cold-hearted killers you could encounter in
Mordheim. There are famous Dwarf gold hunters,
Burgomeisters of the Merchants’ Guild, Theodor, the
marksman of Hochland, and many others. In fact we hope
that the characters detailed here will inspire players to invent
special characters of their own. You can only ever have one
of a particular special character in your warband. A warband
may employ as many special characters as it likes – if it can
afford them!

#### Looking for special characters

After a battle, you can send any number of your
Heroes to look for a special character. Only Heroes can look
(Henchmen are rarely trustworthy enough). Heroes who went
out of action in the last battle are unable to join the search
because they are recovering from their wounds.
Heroes who are looking for a special character cannot look
for rare items. Decide which special character you are

```
seeking, and how many Heroes have been sent to look for
him. Roll a D6 for each searcher. If any of the searchers rolls
under his Initiative he has located the special character. You
can, of course, only find one of a particular special character,
no matter how many searchers roll under their Initiative.
```
#### Hire fee

```
The warband must pay the hire fee for the special character
when he is recruited, and after each battle he fights, including
the first, you must pay an upkeep fee. These fees are
indicated in the entries. This money comes from the
warband’s treasury in the same way as buying new weapons
or recruiting new warriors. If you don’t have enough gold to
pay for the special character he leaves the warband.
```
#### Experience, injuries and equipment

```
Special characters have their own equipment. Only they may
use this equipment; it can’t be given to other warriors.
Furthermore, you cannot buy extra weapons or equipment for
a special character.
Special characters do not earn Experience points, although
they suffer serious injuries, just like Heroes, if they are taken
out of action.
Each special character’s description tells you how much to
add to your warband’s rating for including them (taking into
account their experience and abilities).

##### Aenur, the sword of twilight

Many famous swordsmen have come to Mordheim to make their
fortune, but few can match the terrifying reputation of the Elf
swordsman Aenur. This mighty warrior was responsible for slaying
the entire Possessed warband of Karl Zimmeran, and single-
handedly cleansed the Rat Hole, a settlement that had been overrun
by Beastmen.
Rumours about Aenur’s origin abound. Elves usually avoid human
settlements, and Mordheim in particular, but for some reason the
tall, pale swordsman has stayed in the proximity of the ruined city
for months.
Some say Aenur comes from beyond the Great Ocean, from the
fabled Elven kingdoms, and that he is the captain of the legendary
Order of Swordmasters. Others claim that he is a Wood Elf prince
in exile. Aenur himself says little about his past and those who are
wise do not question him.
Whenever a warband prepares an expedition to explore the inner
city, there is a chance they may hear a sharp rap at the gate of their
encampment – their unexpected visitor will be Aenur, offering his
services to their leader.
If, indeed, Aenur seeks something in the grim ruins of Mordheim,
no-one knows what this might be. Some say that he wishes to
explore the Pit itself, and slay the enigmatic Shadow Lord, though
such a task must surely be above even this mighty warrior.
Aenur is tall even for an Elf, and beneath his finely woven Elven
cloak he wears armour of gleaming ithilmar. He carries a sword of
immense size which is rumoured to have arcane properties.
Certainly no one who has been struck by it has ever lived to tell the
tale.

```
Hire Fee: 150 gold crowns to hire.
May be Hired: Aenur may be hired by any Lawful, Lawful /
Neutral or Neutral warbands except for Dwarven Warbands.

Skills: Aenur has the following skills: Strike to Injure, Expert
Swordsman, Step Aside, Sprint, Lightning Reflexes, Dodge
and Mighty Blow.
SPECIAL RULES
Invincible Swordsman. Aenur always hits his opponents on
a roll of 2+ in hand-to-hand combat.
Wanderer. Aenur only ever stays with a warband for the
duration of the battle. A warband who used Aenur in their
last battle may not seek him out until they have fought at
least one battle without him.
Ienh-Khain (the Hand of Khaine). Ienh-Khain is an
incredibly long single edged sword, which Aenur uses with
consummate skill. This sword allows Aenur to parry, adds +1
to his Strength and causes a critical hit on a roll of 5-6 when
rolling to wound.

##### Johann the knife

“Get your hands off me, brute! Let go of me, and I’ll tell you what I
know. So, you seek Johann the Knife! Take my advice, friend, do not
speak his name out loud. He does not like people talking about him
in the street. What do you seek him for anyway? So, you’ve got a job
for him! Well, why didn’t you say so before? I cannot say where you
might find him, because I do not know myself. Who does? Anyway,
no matter. When he hears word, he will find you soon enough! Ha!
ha! It will cost you though, for he likes gold, does Johann. He knows
this city – what’s left of it – like the back of his hand. If he can’t find
someone, no-one can. He is like a shadow, he can go in and out of
anywhere, unseen. He can also fight his way out of anywhere. No
one can catch him. As quick as lightning with a knife, he is! No
traces, all very neat and tidy. All I need from you is the gold, and the
name. Johann will do the rest.”
Conversation overheard in Mordheim
Of the many cutthroats and assassins for hire that infest the
settlements around Mordheim, Johann the Knife is the most famous.
He exhibits his vocation as hired knife-fighter and assassin
extraordinaire by the various lethal-looking daggers hanging from
his belt, and the mean glint of his eyes. Johann wears dark leather
gear, slightly out of fashion, which has never been washed (or so the
barmaids say). His long face bears the scars of many a fight, and his
unkempt hair is lank and greasy.
Johann’s purse is always heavy with gold, and he takes no trouble to
hide it, since only a fool would try to steal it from him. Many have
tried, and all have died... very quickly. The craftsmanship and
quality of Johann’s daggers is beyond compare, as he has taken
them from the bodies of the many wealthy, but unskilful, opponents
he has despatched in vicious duels.

```
Hire Fee: 70 gold crowns to hire; +30 gold crowns upkeep

him for one portion of Crimson Shade if you wish.

##### Bertha Bestraufrung, High Matriarch of the Sisterhood

Years ago, Bertha sought refuge in the strict discipline and
devotions of the Sisters of Sigmar. Only the warrior god of the
Empire was worthy of her esteem. Only He was constant and
faithful. And had not holy Sigmar, in truth, chosen her to be one of
his handmaidens?
The pure blood of the Unberogens runs in Bertha’s veins, as evinced
by her long golden plaits and fierce blue eyes, which can freeze a
Goblin at twenty paces with an icy glare. Even her voice commands
authority, turning strong, hairy-thewed men into trembling
wretches.
The Sisters look up to Bertha as an example of holy womanhood.
She rose rapidly through the ranks of the Sisterhood, and on her
deathbed the revered Matriarch Cassandra named Bertha her
successor, new High Matriarch, and Abedissa of Sigmar’s Rock.
Sometimes, as Bertha straps on her Gromril armour in the light of
dawn, she reflects on the lost innocence of her youth. Then, angrily,
she tightens the studded leather straps tightly over her iron-hard
limbs and strides outside to spend hours practising with her great
warhammers, preparing herself, as a bride of Sigmar should, for the
day of battle.
Extract from the Tome of Heroes
Hire Fee: None. Bertha will come to the aid of any Sisters of
Sigmar warband if they send one or more of their Heroines to
look for her in the normal manner, rolling under their
Initiative (representing their efforts to gain audience with the
High Matriarch). If she does grant an audience, she might
decide that her personal help is needed in the forthcoming
battle. She will only come to the aid of a Sisters of Sigmar
warband if their enemy has a higher warband rating. Consult
the table below, and roll a D6 to see whether Bertha will aid

made for each battle you wish her to help the warband.

##### Veskit, high executioner of Clan Eshin

“It killed us all! We couldn’t stop it, our weapons broke against its
body... It was black, like a shadow, and it was moving so fast,
cutting men to shreds left and right. We fought, yes we fought hard,
and old Marcus even tried his trick with the oil flask. It was engulfed
by flames and for a moment we thought we’d stopped it. No way, it
came out of the fire, still ablaze. It was as if it didn’t care! That was
too much and those left of us ran for it. Still it followed us, on and
on, relentless and merciless. There was no escaping, no hiding, its
red eye could always spot you. Oh that eye... that eye...”
Last words of Fritz Huber at the Inn of the Red Moon,

Veskit was already a talented clan Eshin Assassin when he was
entrusted with his most difficult mission. He was hired by Clan
Skryre to free one of their oldest and most experienced Warlocks
who was being held hostage by a rival clan.
Veskit managed to take the prisoner back, fighting his way through
the guards, but at a very high cost. He suffered terrible wounds and
would have certainly died, but the Nightmaster of Clan Eshin made
a pact with the Warlock Engineers. The Skaven scientist-sorcerers
replaced various parts of Veskit’s body with their part technological,
part magical implants and made him into a walking arsenal of
deadly weapons. Veskit is now more a machine than a living thing,
and his thirst for killing has become almost uncontrollable.
When news of the wyrdstone came to the hidden fortress of Clan
Eshin, the Nightmaster sent Veskit to Mordheim to deter the man-
things from exploring the city, which rightfully belonged to the
Skaven. From that day on, many adventurers have met their end in
the dark allies of Mordheim. Veskit’s unblinking eye misses
nothing, and those he hunts on the streets of Mordheim never return
to the Gargoyle Gate.

```
Hire Fee: 80 gold crowns to hire; +35 gold crowns upkeep
cost.
May be Hired: Veskit may only be hired by Skaven
warbands.
Rating: Veskit increases the warband’s rating by +70 points.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Weapons/Armour: Eshin Fighting Claws (the extra attack is
included in his profile). Each Fighting Claw incorporates an
in-built warplock pistol, so Veskit can shoot in every turn,
and he fights in close combat with Strength 5 and a save
modifier of -3 (note that he can still parry twice with his
claws!).
SPECIAL RULES
Unfeeling. Veskit is a cold, calculating killing machine, and
feels few of the emotions that living things do. He is
therefore immune to all psychology.
No Pain. Veskit ignores knocked down and stunned results
on the Injury chart. He must lose his last wound and be taken
out of action before he is removed from battle.
Unblinking Eye. Thanks to the sorcerous devices built by the
Warlock Engineers of Clan Skryre, Veskit can spot hidden
enemies within twice his Initiative value in inches.
Metallic Body. These give Veskit his high Toughness and a
3+ armour save.
Skaven: Veskit like all Skaven, only lookout for themself
and so they would stab (or shoot) you in the back if the need
arose. Veskit will shoot in to combat with on care for the
safely of others. For each shot roll a D6 on a 1-3 the shot hits
a friendly model.

##### Ulli & Marquand

Never in the history of the Empire have there been such a villainous pair of rogues as Marquand Volker and Ulli Leitpold. Once brigands in
a mercenary regiment responsible for a long list of crimes, they were caught by bounty hunters and enlisted into the slave army of the Count
of Stirland. The pair escaped their captors on the outskirts of Mordheim, City of the Damned, a ruinous place where death and glory could
be found in equal measure. The infamous bandits instantly recognised it as home.
Ulli and Marquand quickly developed a strong rapport with the scum of Mordheim, a place Inhabited by the corrupt and immoral outcasts of
society. Their martial prowess and ruthless guile soon earned the nefarious partners in crime a high degree of notoriety. As a result, the less
noble traders and prospectors of the accursed city eagerly sought out the services of these talented scoundrels.
But their assistance did not come without a high price. Whilst the pair would consider any task thrown their way for a mere handful of gold
coin, their loyalty was as fickle as the winds of Chaos. They built up a reputation of betraying employers and stabbing them in the back for
the sake of a single crown. They were certainly not beyond using foul and despicable tricks to save their own worthless hides or line their
own pockets.
What became of the despicable pair, none can say but legends of their deeds can to this day be heard in taverns throughout the Old World.
Each story is more outlandish than the next but few ever doubt the truth behind these fantastic tales.
May be Hired: Ulli and Marquand may be hired by any Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic warbands.
Hire Fee: 30 Gold Crowns to hire as a pair.
Rating: Ulli and Marquand increase the warband rating by +60 points.
Marquand Volker
Reputedly the son of wealthy Marienburg merchants, what made
Marquand embark on a career as a gambler and then a mercenary
and assassin is unknown. What is known about this apparent ‘fop’ is
that his appearance belies his true nature for he is quite deadly and
entirely devoid of any morals. Marquand personifies Mordheim
‘The City of the Damned’ for he is corrupt and rotten to the core –
just like that place he calls his ‘home’. An expert swordsman and
master of the throwing knife, there are few who have crossed him
and lived. In the darkened corners of taverns, tales are told in
nervous whispers about this cold-hearted killer’s reputation: that he
killed his first victim before he was ten; that he cut the heart out of
the Duke of Suddenland while the Duke’s wife slept on beside him.
His deadliest foe is the Witch Hunter captain Gottlieb, ‘The Flayer’,
whose face Marquand horribly disfigured whilst the erstwhile
servant of Sigmar was attempting to redeem Marquand of his sins.

Ulli Leitpold
Marquand’s sidekick and partner in crime. Little is known about this
huge framed Middenheimer, apart from it is unwise to be caught
anywhere near the business end of his massive warhammer! The
tales tell that Ulli Leitpold started out as a mercenary soldier, often
in the service of the armies of the Count of Stirland, and that he was
present at the slaughter that ensued at the third siege of Nuln. Life as
a mercenary is presumably where he derives his unthinking greed
and cold nature, no doubt. Ulli spent some time as a bandit and thief
and teamed up with Marquand when they were captured by bounty
hunters and sentenced to live out their days in the penal battalions of
the Count of Stirland. Neither as subtle or as flash as his Marienburg
colleague, Ulli prefers to use a combination of brute force and low
cunning to achieve his goals.

SPECIAL RULES
These special rules apply to both Ulli and Marquand.
Wanderer: Ulli and Marquand only ever stays with a
warband for the duration of the battle. A warband who used
Ulli and Marquand in their last battle may not seek him out
until they have fought at least one battle without him.
A Fistful of Crowns: These guys will do literally anything
for money / Wyrdstone and have been known to change sides
and stab their former employers in the back for just a few
crowns. To represent this, opposing player(s) may attempt to
bribe the pair into betraying their employers and changing
sides. At the start of the game, any player(s) wishing to do
this must secretly write down how much he is willing to bribe
them by (this must of course be more than the pair’s starting
hire fee!). The controlling/employing player is advised to
secretly write down a counter bid at the start of the game
also. The bribing player may then choose at the start of any of
his turns to attempt to bribe them (even if they are in close
combat!). If he does so he must reveal the amount he has
written down and if this is more than the hire fee plus the
amount the controlling player has for his counter-bid, then he
gains control of the pair until the end of the game. Only the
player who has control of the pair is forced to pay the
additional amount so that if the original controlling player

```
loses control of them through a bribe he doesn’t have to pay
the counter-bid.
This bribing business can of course get quite interesting in
multi-player games with different players attempting to bribe
at different times.
Whichever player succeeds in bribing, or if the controlling
player maintains control, they must pay this extra amount.
Where’s the Money? These guys are not likely to accept any
poor excuses if a warband cannot afford their extra pay. In
the event that a player cannot pay the extra either in crowns
or Wyrdstone (The warband should sell any Wyrdstone
necessary in order to pay the hire or bribe) the pair will
deprive the warband of an equal amount in equipment (based
on market price). Failing this, they will take out their anger
on the warband leader – immediately play a close combat
with the pair versus the warband leader on his own and to the
death!
Inseparable: These guys are like brothers (very nasty,
unpleasant brothers!) and are totally inseparable. They must
be hired as a pair and must remain within 8" of each other. In
the event that one is taken Out of Action, the other will
attempt to drag him off of the battlefield and to safety.
In a campaign, if one member of the partnership retires then
the other will retire.

##### Nicodemus, the cursed pilgrim

By Alessio Cavatore
Nicodemus was a promising apprentice to the mighty wizard
Ganthrandir. During one of his master’s many absences, Nicodemus
felt an irresistible call from one of the ancient artefacts stored in the
wizard’s laboratory: an exotic magic lantern. Created when the
world was but young, this mighty artefact imprisoned the essence of
a powerful Daemon. Many times Nicodemus’ master had warned
him not to touch the dangerous lantern, but the voice in the young
wizard’s mind was more convincing than even his mentor’s: “Free
me” it was saying “and I will grant you your heart’s desire –
anything you want will be yours! Mine is the power to make it so!
Free me...” Nicodemus knew something of dealing with these
denizens from the Realm of Chaos and immediately asked: “Do you
swear it on the name of the Power you serve?” After a moment of
silence, the voice answered: “I swear it in the name of my Master!”
So the ambitious but naive young wizard was hooked and proceeded
to break the runic seals of the lantern.
“Free at last!” boomed the voice of the Daemon as it emerged from
its prison in a billowing, many-hued cloud. The smoke then seemed
to coalesce into the vague shape of a huge humanoid creature, with
a bird-like head atop a long thin neck and vast wings seemingly
made of iridescent light. The Daemon looked down on the human,
and Nicodemus, controlling his fear, shouted: “The wish! You must
grant me the wish as you swore it!” The mighty Chaos being smiled
enigmatically and asked: “What is your wish then, manling?”
Fighting hard against all the instincts telling him to flee as far as he
could from this unearthly abomination, Nicodemus revealed his
wish: “I want to become the greatest wizard known to Mankind!”
A few long heartbeats later the fiery gaze of the Daemon left the
wizard: “Granted!” whispered the Daemon and with one last evil
chuckle disappeared back to the netherworld from whence it came.
Nicodemus did not perceive any immediate change and wondered
how long it would take for the wish to come true. Only one thing
was clear, he could not stay there anymore, because his master
would certainly not be pleased by his actions. So Nicodemus picked
up his things and fled, beginning his wanderings across the Old
World.
Only a few weeks after that fateful day did Nicodemus realise the
Daemon’s trickery. His body was growing abnormally quickly – he
was now an inch taller than the previous week and his body was
getting proportionally bigger. The greatest wizard! The cunning
Daemon had taken his wish too literally! Nicodemus had been
taught to be extremely careful with the wording of anything related
to wish-magic, but the sheer terror generated by the Daemon had
overcome his training... Now he was doomed to live with his
mistake.
From that day on, the life of Nicodemus has been an uninterrupted
quest, a desperate search for a way to negate the curse of

```
unstoppable growth. The only remedy he has stumbled upon is a
powerful potion concocted by a wise hermit he met in the World’s
Edge Mountains. The potion’s ability to delay the effects of the
Daemon’s powers has become a lifeline for the sizeable wizard.
Unfortunately for Nicodemus he requires regular infusions of
wyrdstone for the potion to take effect. Thus Nicodemus has been
drawn to the greatest concentration of this wondrous mineral –
Mordheim, City of the Damned.
Nicodemus’s skills have greatly developed during his time in the
dark streets of Mordheim and he is now something of a legend
among the many warbands vying for supremacy in the city. Who
knows where he will appear next and who will he join in his never
ending search for the precious magic stones...

Cursed: Nicodemus is not interested in money, he
desperately needs fragments of wyrdstone to delay his
abnormal growth. When he joins the warband and after each
battle he fights, including the first, you must pay him with a
Wyrdstone shard. If you don’t have a shard or if you don’t
want to give it to Nicodemus and prefer to sell it, the cursed
pilgrim will leave the warband, never to return.
Wizard’s Staff. Nicodemus can use his staff in close combat
in two different ways: he can use the staff with both hands, in
which case the staff counts as a club, but also allows
Nicodemus to parry as if he was armed with a buckler;
alternatively Nicodemus can use the staff in his left hand as a
normal club while he’s wielding the Sword of Rezhebel (see
Lesser Magic spells) in his right hand.
Note: the Sword of Rezhebel is a spell and not a normal
sword, therefore it cannot be used to parry.

##### The Dark Jester

By Nicodemus Kyme
The day upon which the travelling players of Papa Noigal’s troupe visited the sleepy village of Markus Schnapp will be one forever etched in
memory. They swept into the village square full of the promise of death-defying stunts, heart wrenching tales of daring do, star-crossed
lovers and fallen heroes wracked by ambition. What they delivered was quite different...
Markus had been sent to work in the fields, a punishment forshirking his chores, a boy of only sixteen he was oft lost in his imaginings of
becoming a great hero of the Empire, desperate to be respected by his kin. Alas, destiny thought otherwise...
Little did Markus realise then as he headed off far into the outlying barley and corn of his home, grumbling at his rough treatment that such
an act would both save and damn him.
Hours he toiled in bright summer sunshine that threatened to wither the crop such was its strength, a curious stench of over-ripening fruit
ever present upon the waning breeze. Weary and in foul mood Markus returned to a scene of horror the likes of which no theatre could ever
hope to contrive; his family, friends and fellows all slain. A disease ran through the entire village, homes burned and bodies rotted with
frighteningly accelerated decomposition. Fruit sagged from sickened black boughs like deflated intestine, livestock lay dead infested with
flies, maggots and other putrescence.
For long moments Markus stumbled from corpse to corpse recognising people he had known, that he had loved. Curiously no woman or
child could be found amongst the decaying carnage and yet there was something amidst the horror that drew him. Where the hastily erected
stage had been Markus noticed a face smeared in thick mud made slick by whatever devilry had been at work there. He pulled it, dazedly,
from the mire. It was a mask, fashioned from a deep green lustreless wood.
Without knowing why and powerless to stop himself, Markus turned the mask around. For a moment all else was forgotten; his feeling of loss
ebbed, the notion of standing amidst the chaos faded and all that was left was Markus and the mask and the seeming promise of all his
unconscious desires, all for the taking within the mask.
As he placed it upon his face it seared his skin, foul boils and pustules erupting immediately upon his flesh conjoining, horribly, mask and
boy as one. For the mask held the spirit of a powerful daemon, bound within, that had now merged with a fresh host. The boy, Markus
Schnapp was no more, the daemon that possessed him a trickster, it warped his form into that of a terrible Jester, a dark, mocking figure that
sought only malice and suffering through his macabre humour. Markus has been driven mad by the daemon and wanders the forests and
villages of the Empire occasionally in the company of those that destroyed his former life such is the dark irony of Chaos, harbouring the
daemon, waiting for it to fill him utterly and gorge itself in a flurry of bloodshed and violence...

points.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Jester 4 3 3 3 3 2 6 2 7
Weapons/Armour: The Dark Jester has a skeleton ‘hobby
horse’ (counts as a club) and a sack of spikes (counts as a
morning star) which he wields in humorous fashion in
combat.
Skills: The Dark Jester has the following skills: Leap,
Acrobat, Lightning Reflexes, Jump Up and Dodge.
Special Rules:
Loner: The Dark Jester is used to walking the lone path,
content with the schizophrenic comforts on the daemon he
harbours. As such he never has to test for being ‘All-alone’.
Confound and Confuse: In combat the Dark Jester uses a
series of distraction and confounding ‘tricks’ to gain the
upper-hand on his hapless adversaries. At the start of each
combat turn (his and his opponents) he may select one of the
‘tricks’ below to use in that round.
Sidestepper The Dark Jester weaves and bobs in combat
as he were a puppet hung from preternatural, prescient
strings. In hand-to-hand combat the Dark Jester has a
special dodge save of 4+ that cannot be modified by the
strength of the attack.
Babbling banter The Dark Jester babbles inanely and
taunts his opponents distracting them and opening up their
defences as they recklessly try to silence him. All enemy
models in base-to-base contact with the Dark Jester are at

```
-1 to hit in hand-to-hand combat and their opponents are
at +1 to hit those affected.
Trip The Dark Jester lures his opponent toward him with
a few cutting taunts and then deftly steps aside their fatal
swipe to upend them into the dirt. The Dark Jester may
forgo rolling to ‘wound’ after a single attack and may
instead elect to ‘trip’ his opponent. The Dark Jester rolls a
D6. On a roll of 2+ his opponent is tripped and counts as
‘knocked down’.
THE DAEMON WITHIN...
The daemon that Markus harbours within the mask is a
malicious creature that yearns for cruelty and carnage. When
battle is joined on the blood-soaked streets it takes little
provocation for the beast to surface to the misery of all... At
the start of each of the Dark Jester’s turn before movement
roll a D6. On a roll of 1 the daemon has emerged to possess
the Dark Jester’s form, imbuing him with rage and near
invulnerability! Whilst possessed by the daemon the Dark
Jester’s strength increases by +2, he is frenzied and may re-
roll all missed hits in close combat. Furthermore he is
immune to psychology but must always move towards the
nearest enemy at +D6” move and cannot perform any Jester
tricks.
Whilst in daemon form the Dark Jester is impervious to pain
and ignores all injuries but still roll to wound as normal.
At the start of each subsequent turn roll a D6 on a roll of 6
the Dark Jester returns to normal and suffers any wounds and
must make injury rolls for any attacks that take him to zero
wounds and beyond whilst he was possessed all at once! This
may of course result in the Dark Jester being ‘out of action’
but such is the fickle nature of chaos...

##### Countess Marianna Chevaux, Vampire Assassin

By Nicodemus Kyme
Once an assassin-thief, Marianna’s ambitions outreached her. In a
daring expedition to Araby, she came into contact with the ancient
Vampiress Serutat. Marianna succeeded in her mission, stealing the
gem, the Noctu, from Serutat’s crypt but the Vampiress caught up
with her, tainting her with the curse of Vampirism before the
resourceful assassin could escape.
In a moment Marianna had become a thing of the night and yet she
was not completely damned, a half-vampire. Sating her bloodlust on
the numerous courtesans, captains and suitors that came her way,
Marianna fled the bitter vengeance of the Lahmian Vampire,
Serutat, to Mordheim. With the City of the Damned her relative
anonymity would be assured.
Marianna is a pragmatist, neutral in her persona, serving only her
own means, hiring her skills out as an assassin, taking care to
conceal her secret. Wary of witch hunters and the other devout
servants of Sigmar, Marianna is a creature of the shadows, her
vampiric powers enhancing her abilities immeasurably. And yet the
flight to Mordheim serves an ulterior motive. Vampire turned
Vampire Hunter and as such an exile in the dark Undead
underworld, Marianna tracks the night-stalkers of Mordheim,
torturing them for information; the whereabouts of Serutat and the
true nature of the Noctu, the black jewel stolen from her crypt.
Marianna’s efforts have borne dark fruit, a word of power and the
stone will create a veil of shadow to cloak the bearer, drifting like a
black ether. Marianna means to seek out Serutat in her lair when
she is vulnerable, exacting her own vengeance for damning her to
darkness, her ‘interrogations’ warning her that the Vampire has
travelled to the Empire to settle the score and retrieve the Noctu. A
plethora of aliases have kept Marianna hidden so far but
occasionally, during a battle in the deepest recesses of the city,
minions of Serutat will appear out of the night to exact their
mistress’s vengeance, much to the surprise of the vying warbands.
Marianna walks a dagger-thin line but thus far she has yet to slip...

Hire Fee: 150 gold crowns to hire; 75 gold crowns upkeep
(varies see below).
May Be Hired: Countess Marianna Chevaux may be hired
by any Lawful / Neutral, Neutral or Neutral / Chaotic
warbands except for Dwarven, Elven, Undead warbands or
any warband with a Warrior-Priest or Witch Hunter.
Rating: Marianna increases the warband’s rating by +90
points.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Marianna 6 6 6 4 4 2 9 3 9
Weapons/Armour: Marianna carries a rapier, dagger and
has a set of throwing knives and a crossbow pistol concealed
about her person. Her crossbow bolts and rapier are coated in
essence of garlic, which acts as Black Lotus when used
against Vampires. She also has quite an extensive wardrobe
of very expensive Bretonnian silk dresses!

```
Skills: Marianna has the following skills: Combat Master,
Step Aside, Leap, Acrobat, Lightning Reflexes, Dodge, Jump
Up and Scale Sheer Surface.
SPECIAL RULES
Immune to Psychology: As a Vampire, Marianna is
completely immune to the effects of psychology and will
never leave combat.
Immune to Poison: As a Vampire, Marianna is completely
immune to the effects of poison.
No Pain: Marianna treats a stunned result on the Injury chart
as knocked down instead (note that with her Jump Up ability
Marianna cannot be knocked down either so the only way to
stop her is to take her out of action!).
Cause Fear: Marianna is a terrifying creature, although more
through reputation than her being a Vampire as she is
contriving to keep her identity a secret.
‘You can never escape your past...’: On the last turn of the
game in which Marianna is still standing or as soon as a
warband routs, ending the game, roll a D6:
1-3 Marianna has discovered that Serutat is getting close and
will leave the warband’s service after the game.
4-5 Marianna has discovered a useful lead that she must
pursue in this area and will stay for another game if the
warband can afford her upkeep.
6 A group of Serutat’s minions have caught up with her!
Fight D3 more turns as if the losing warband hadn’t routed
(in the confusion the balance is reset). A randomly
determined group of minions ‘appear’ within 2D6" of
Marianna, the opposing player chooses where. Marianna
takes the first turn and then the minions, after which the turn
sequence returns to normal with the minions counted as a an
extra player. The minions only attack Marianna and must
move towards her as fast as possible but will attack anyone
else in their way. If her warband fight to help her (by taking
at least one minion out of action) and she survives, Marianna
will fight the next battle for free, otherwise she will leave.
Roll D6 Minions
1-2 D3+1 Zombies
3-4 D3+1 Ghouls
5-6 Vampire (Sword & light armour) +2 Ghouls
Fighting Undead: Due to her vocation as a Vampire
Assassin turned Vampire Hunter, all Vampires Hate
Marianna.
The Noctu: The gemstone stolen from Serutat’s lair has
powerful cloaking properties. The veil of shadow it creates
reduces all shooting to hit rolls against Marianna by -1.

##### A Struggle for Power

By Nicodemus Kyme
Of all the mysteries of Albion perhaps the greatest is the purpose of

to thwart the Dark Master and his lackeys.
The Dark Calling has even reach as far as the isle of Albion,
with the struggle for power between the Dark Emissaries and
the Truthsayers has ending in a stalemate. To solve this, the
Dark Master has sent this Dark Emissaries to the city on

Truthsayers have found out about this and followed them to
Mordheim.

##### Dijin Katal, The Renegade Assassin

How many years have I walked the earth?
How many plains have I seen that stretch to the horizon? How many
cities are there that are crammed with the filth and dregs of this
world? And how many dark places have been my refuges? Yet I still
miss that dreaded place Clar Karond... my home. I wonder what is
happening amongst my kin what devious politics abound. Oh, how I
miss the intrigue of a true civilisation. These are strange times. I
never desired to travel to this hot insect infested land of Lustria but
now I am here it has a strange hold on me. I have delivered many to
the grace of Khaine within this jungle. This jungle seems to cry out
for blood. Although my murderous instincts have grown the animal
inside is now in sated. What has become of me?
Still, my blades run with the blood of my enemies the only thing that
brings me comfort. I have the murderous instinct, which my people
have practised for thousands of years and the addiction is strong.
That night when I saw the broken bodies of my own kin on the floor
in the carnival of horrors I knew that killing was my sole purpose. I
also knew that it didn’t matter who would be my prey – friend or foe
it makes to difference to the unquenchable thirst within. And now my
comrades hunt me. Although my thirst for another murder is great in
good time soon it shall be quenched. My life is for Khaine.
My goal? To find some meaning to this mundane existence...
Known as ‘The Hunter in the Shadows’, ‘The Thrice Cursed
Renegade’, ‘He who Thirsts’ and ‘Kinslayer’, among other things,
Dijin Katal as greatly feared and loathed and that’s just by his own
people. The covens of the Druchii have a price on Katal’s head and
demand that he be captured alive for the Hag Queen’s pleasure. Few
know this Druchii’s chequered past when they hire him in fact most
are not even aware that he is Druchii, such is their ignorance.

```
Hire fee: 85 gold crowns: 40 gold crowns upkeep.
May be Hired: Dijin Katal may be hired by any Lawful /
Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic warbands
except for Dwarves and Elves warbands or any warband that
includes and type of Elven or Dwarven hired swords.

Weapons/Armour: Dijin Katal wears a Druchii Assassin’s
cloak and wields two swords coated with Dark venom and a
repeater crossbow.
Skills: Dijin katal has the following skills: Strike to injure,
Quick shot, Dodge, Lightning reflexes and Trick shooter.
Special Rules
Kindred Hatred: The Dark Elves have been fighting the
High Elves for many centuries. The wars between the two
races have been very long and bloody affairs. The Dark Elves
are very bitter since they have been exiled from Ulthuan and
thus they hate any High Elf warriors including High Elf
Hired Swords.
Excellent Sight: There are numerous legends detailing the
excellent eyesight of the Elves, both Druchii and Ulthuan kin.
Elves can spot hidden enemies from twice as far away than
normal warriors (i.e. twice their Initiative value in inches).
Shadows Embrace: The Dark Elf has mastered the art of
making the best use of shadows to hide, this is the legendary
ability of the Dark Elf Scouts and the Assassins. If the Dark
Elf is in cover and a model attempts to charge him, he can
only charge the Elf using a charge move equal to his initiative
in inches. In addition, missile weapons suffer an additional -1
penalty to hit on top of the penalty for cover.
Perfect Killer: All attacks made by the Assassin, whether in
shooting or close combat, have an extra -1 save modifier to
represent his skill in striking at unarmoured spots.
Renegade: Dijin is a kinslayer and therefore a renegade in
Druchii eyes. Any Dark Elves that Dijin is fighting against
will suffer Hatred towards him.
Wanderer: Dijin Katal only ever stays with a warband for
the duration of the battle. A warband who used Dijin Katal in
their last battle may not seek him out until they have fought
at least one battle without him.

##### Drenok Johansen, Wielder of the great axe

The great sagas of the Norse tribes tell of a mighty warrior known
as the Wielder of the Great Axe. Long ago in the icy, inhospitable
tundra of the Norse land a young clansman with fire in his eyes and
passion in his heart left his clan in search of his father’s fate. His
father was Johan warrior-prime, Chieftain of the Clan Icefang,
possessed by a demon of Khorne. His father had disappeared
rumoured to have travelled across the seas. Leaving the clan in a
self-imposed exile he was never seen again in the lands of his birth.
After many a long year within the realms of the Old World Drenok
took ship to the New World in search of his father. Weeks dragged
on into months and months into years until finally the day came
when the two mortals finally crossed paths. Only then did Drenok
truly know fear. For when Drenok looked into the face of his father
he saw the Daemon within. A titanic struggle ensued between father
and son. The battle was fierce and long, lasting for many hours.
With each wound Drenok inflicted upon this demon, his father,
anguish and rage consumed his soul. Finally his father fell and the
battle was won. But this was no true victory this was a day of
mourning. For Drenok had now lost a part of his soul he could
never reclaim. He gazed upon the great axe, which lay at the feet of
his father’s corpse and realised it to be the legendary axe of the
Icefang, his clan. Lifting the mighty axe above his head, his hair
braids blowing in the wind he roared in defiance of world. His quest
would be to bring honour to the death of his father.

##### The Emissary of the Horned Rat, The Vermin Lord

By Paul H
They are great, powerful creatures surrounded by an aura of
creeping decay and inscrutable knowledge. Their heads are
bedecked with the spiralling horns and sloughing flesh of the
Horned Rat himself. Warpstone amulets and torcs decorate the
Vermin Load’s leprous form, along with chunks of raw warpstone
hammered into it flesh. Vermin Lords have often seen armed with a
huge, wicked-looking glaives that are twice the height of a man but
their chisel-teeth and Sharp claws are easily capable to tearing a
creature to pieces. These fearsome creatures are made of the very
stuff of Chaos, and are extremely difficult to kill.

cost.

from the outer planes of existence. As such, they cause fear.
In addition to this, their demonic nature gives them a natural
4+ save against any and all spells cast at them, which may
never be modified in any way. Finally, the Vermin Lords are
affected as any other demon by blessed water.
Magic User: The Vermin Lord has the ability to use magic
and casts spells like any other magicians, and the Vermin

##### The Salesman

By Natascha Chrobok, This Dramatis Personae was inspired by "Tales of the ten Tailed cat" in Inferno no. 29
"Waiter, an ale please. Actually, I'm simply glad to be alive! Really.
You see, I visited this inn, up by the market place. A little like this
establishment... the ale was no quite as good as this, but close. Well,
I saw something you wouldn't believe...
The inn was full of real low-lifes. Not like the fine fellows you've got
here; I mean REAL SCUM!
Anyway, I'm sitting there and in walks the biggest salesman I have
ever seen! Big as ships. Like the ones here at the docks. The
salesman fellow walks right up to the bar. He's carrying a big case,
and he sits it down beside him as though it were his trusted hound.
So this fellow orders a drink and starts talking to the innkeeper, to
the customers, those unsavoury characters I mentioned, and he says
something that upsets them. Something like... like: "half now, half on
delivery. Whatever it was angered those people something terrible.
They started bulling knives, swords, crossbows, starting some
trouble.
So the salesman leaps from the bar, snatches up his case and he
dives in! Just dives right in! I don't know what he did down there,
but he came back up with the biggest hand bow I have ever seen. It
was judgement day in there! I was frozen stiff! All I could do was
watch while this, this thing took the inn apart! Nobody was alive
when the salesman had finished his bloody work...
I heard, he's coming this way..."
Nobody exactly knows his name or where he came from.
Some say that he was once an estalian Nobleman, tricked by
a Marienburger merchant. He lost his title and all his
possessions to that merchant and since that time the Salesman
is looking for the merchant. He hunted him throughout the
whole old world, leaving a bloody trail on his way. There are
rumours that the Salesman has been seen in the Twisted Goat
inn...

#### Attack Animals

The most common attack animal in the Old World is the
faithful war house, especially favoured by Witch Hunters.
Other warbands have their favoured attack animals – Giant
Rats for Skaven, Dire Wolves for Vampires, Cold One Beast-
hounds for the Druchii. Whatever the differences between the
species, that a warrior with several sets of claws and jaws
behind him is a more dangerous opponent than a warrior on
his own.

Special Rules
Model: If you purchase an Attack Animal, it will fight exactly like a
member of your warband, though it is treated as part of the
equipment of the Hero who bought it. You will need a model to
represent it on a battlefield.
Experience: Attack Animals never gain experience, and if they are
put out of action they have exactly the same chance of recovering as
Henchmen (i.e., 1-2: Dead; 3-6: Alive). Attack Animal count
towards the maximum number of warriors allowed in your warband.

Bear
Bears are large animals often found in the forests of the Old World.
Normally they are peaceful creatures but when they feel threatened
they rip into their opponents with sharp deadly claws. Their strong
arms can wrap around a Warrior and slowly squeeze the life out of
him.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Black Bear 5 3 - 4 4 2 4 2 4
Grizzly Bear 5 3 - 5 5 2 3 3 4
Special Rules
Animal Companion: The Black Bear may be an Animal
Companion to a warrior
Bear Hug: If the Bear hits the same enemy warrior with both
of his attacks in the same round of combat, the player may
choose to make a single ‘Bear Hug’ attack instead of
resolving the attacks normally. If this option is chosen, each
player must roll a D6 and add his model’s Strength to the
roll. If the Bear’s total is higher or the totals are equal, the
opposing warrior takes a single automatic wound with no
armour save allowed. If the enemy warrior’s total is higher,
the warrior has broken the Bear’s hold and suffers no damage
from the attack.
Experience
+1 For taking the Attack Animal out of action. The Hero
or Henchman that puts the Bear out of action gets a bonus +1
experience.

Birds of Prey
Falcons and other birds of prey are much sort after by beast masters

Cave Squig 2D6 4 0 4 3 1 4 1 5

Special Rules
Animal Companion: The Cave Squig may be an Animal
Companion to a warrior
May Ride: A Goblin may ride the Cave Squig, if you are
using the optional rules for mounts. The Goblin gains +1
armour save, and shall move at the Cave Squig’s rate of 6".
Shooting attacks hit the Goblin on a die roll of 1-2, and the
Cave Squig on a 3-6. In close combat, the opponent may
choose which to hit. The Cave Squig no longer has to follow
the ‘Minderz’ rule (see below) if it is being ridden, as the
owning model is directing its actions.
Minderz: Each Cave Squig must always remain within 6" of
it owning model, who keeps the creature in line. If a Cave
Squig finds itself without the owning model within 6" at the
start of its Movement phase, it will go wild. From that point
on, move the Squig 2D6" in a random direction during each
of its Movement phases. If its movement takes it into contact
with another model (friend or foe), it will engage the model
in hand-to-hand combat as normal. The Cave Squig is out of
the player’s control until the end of the game.
Movement: Cave Squigs do not have a set Movement
characteristic but move with an ungainly bouncing stride. To
represent this, when moving Squigs, roll 2D6 for the distance
they move. Squigs never run and never declare charges.
Instead, they are allowed to contact enemy models with their
normal 2D6" movement. If this happens, they count as
charging for the following round of close combat, just as if
they had declared a charge.
Experience
+1 For taking the Attack Animal out of action. The Hero
or Henchman that puts the Cave Squig out of action gets a

Beast-hound lives in swamps and bogs. Cold One Beast-hounds are
larger than war dogs and of similar build but are in all other
respects reptilian. Rows of sharp teeth fill its maw, and when
provoked, the Cold One Beast-hound is a very aggressive beast. The
Dark Elves capture and train these creatures to fight in battles all
over the Warhammer world.

cannot be modified beyond 6 due to strength modifiers but
any result of ‘no save’ on the injury chart will negate the
unmodified 6+ save.

Familiar
Wizards are often solitary, usually shunned by those who can barely
conceive of, much less understand, the power these individuals
wield. As such, they often share their lives with animal companions,
rather than more ‘sentient’ beings. Sometimes a magical link will
develop between one of these animals and the wizard, to the extent
that the wizard begins to see through the animal’s eyes, and hear its
thoughts. Wizards in different lands favour different types of
familiars, depending on their environment: Shadow Weavers tend to
favour darkly-coloured animals that can blend into the shadows
with them easily- ravens or darkly-coloured cats are most common.
Regardless of their form, familiars are actually not normal members
of their kind at all, but rather creatures that have somehow become
attuned to the Winds of Magic.
Familiars cannot actually be purchased as normal equipment.
The cost to ‘purchase’ a familiar actually represents the cost
of materials to cast the ritual to summon a familiar and form
a magical bond with it; the Rarity level represents the
chances of the ritual actually working. As such, the cost of
the familiar must always be paid if the rarity roll is attempted,
regardless of the success of the roll. Also, only Magic User
can attempt to ‘find’ a familiar. If a familiar is found, it
should be modelled on the Magic User as with any other
piece of equipment. A familiar may be placed on a separate
base (in fact many of the familiars that GW sells come this
way), but if this is done the familiar must always remain
within 6" of the Magic User, may and it may attack enemy
models or be attacked itself, other than the effect below.

Re-roll: As long as the Familiar is within 1" of the Magic
User, the Magic User may re-roll one failed roll to cast a spell
each turn. The result of this re-roll must be accepted, even if
it fails.
Combat Familiar: As long as the Combat Familiar is within
1" of the Magic User, the Magic User’s Weapon Skill and
Attacks increases by 1. This may take the Magic User over
the Maximum.
Power Familiar: As long as the Power Familiar is within 1"
of the Magic User, the range of all Magic User Spell

Spell Familiar: As long as the Spell Familiar is within 1" of

Harpies
The Harpies are jealously protective of the wyrdstone in their nest.
If any model approaches within their charge range then they will
charge. The Harpies will try and coordinate their attacks so at least
one stays back and protects the nest. Therefore, a Harpy may
disengage from a fallen enemy model if there is an opportunity for
one of its companions to charge another model.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Harpy 4 4 0 4 4 1 2 1 6
Special Rules:
Talons: A Harpy has talons and is accustomed to fighting
unarmed so does not suffer a penalty for doing so.
Fly: A Harpy may fly up to 12". After the Movement phase
the model is assumed to have landed and may be charged. If
on the ground, a Harpy may make a full move and then use
its wings.
Drop Attack: If a Harpy is successful with both attacks in
the first round of combat then the Harpy has successfully
grabbed on to her enemy and swoops back up in the air to
drop the model allowing gravity to do the work instead. The
attacks themselves do not wound, but the person controlling
the Harpy immediately rolls a D6 and a Scatter dice. That is
the distance and direction from the place where the attack
took place that the model will rest. Next the player
controlling the Harpy rolls another D6. This is the distance
from which the model has been dropped. The result is the
Strength of hit (Strength 1 to Strength 6). Normal falling
rules apply. If a model falls into a building than count the fall
to where they land and then determine if the model falls again
if it is within 1" of the edge of the floor. Any model that is
struck by the dropped model will suffer a S3 hit. Large
targets may only be dropped D3 inches since their size and
weight make them more difficult to pick up. Once its
opponent is dropped the Harpy may continue flying and
return to the nest, preparing for another attack. Models that
are stunned or knocked down will not be charged as it is too
difficult for the Harpy to fly that close to the ground and do a
drop attack.

Henchman that puts the Harpy out of action gets a bonus +1

Trolls
Trolls are large and foul creatures, with gangling limbs and cold,
damp hides. Renowned for their strength and unthinking ferocity,
Trolls can rip a man apart with their bare hands. Trolls are able to
regenerate damaged flesh, and so are all but impossible to kill. Not
only that, they have the ability to vomit the corrosive contents over
their victim, melting armour, flesh and bone with ease. One
particularly vicious form of Troll is the Stone Troll, whose hide is as
tough as rock. They have the strange ability of sucking the very
power of magic out of the surrounding area. River Trolls live in the
marshlands or swamps near the banks of rivers. Their flesh exhumes
a vile slime which chokes anyone nearby.

Wild Boar
Large, ferocious and bad-tempered – a perfect mount for an Orc
Warlord. Orc warbands occasionally make use of these noisome
beasts while exploring the ruins of Mordheim and beyond. It isn’t
common though, as the bigger and meaner Orcs tend to take the
boars for themselves.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Boar 7 3 0 3 4 1 3 1 3
A boar has an Armour Save of 5+.
Special Rules
Ferocious Charge: Wild boars attack with +2S when
charging, due to their bulk. Note that this applies only to the
boar, not the rider.
Thick Skinned: The thick skin and matted fur of the boar
makes him very hard to wound. Boars confer an additional
+1 bonus to the rider’s Armour Save (making +2 total). If an
Orc Hero (not Henchmen) comes in contact with a boar he
may roll 2D6 to try and tame it. On a 10 or higher the boar
can be tamed and the boar will discharge D3 wyrdstone for
the Orc Hero. Sounds nasty, but Orcs don’t really care about
the smell. Anyway the Orc would make a Goblin or Snotling
clean off the wyrdstone for him.

```
Optional Rules
For each wyrdstone shard the wild boar eats may bring on a
mutation, Roll a D6 for each shard eaten, on a 5+ the wild
boar begin to mutate Roll on the table below for the mutation
each boar gets. Not on the forth mutation roll a D6 on a 1 – 2
the Boar will die and on a 3+ the Boar will became a chaos
spawn.
D6 Mutation
1 Tentacle: A tentacle emerges from the boar’s body. It may use
this to grapple its opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks by
-1, down to a minimum of 1. The boar may choose which attack is
lost.
2 Blackblood: If the boar loses a wound in close combat, anyone in
base contact with it suffers a S3 hit (that will not cause a critical)
from the spurting corrosive blood.
3 Spines: Any model in base contact with the boar suffers an
automatic S1 hit at the beginning of each Close Combat phase.
Spines will never cause critical hits.
4 Scorpion tail: The boar’s tail changes and grows a poisoned barb.
It gets +1A per turn in close combat. This attack is at S5 (or S2 if
the target is immune to poison).
5 Hideous: The boar causes fear.
6 Scales: Armour Save increases to 3+.

Daemonic Instability: daemons are bound to the world by
Dark Sorcery that is highly volatile and unstable. If taken out
of action the daemon is banished and effectively destroyed on

daemon (of the same Chaos God) must take an immediate
Leadership test. If this test is failed, then the daemon (of the
same Chaos God) counts as destroyed.
Immune to Poison: Daemons are created from who know
what, and so all daemons are totally immune to all poisons
and diseases.

and no matter how many warriors are involved it may roll to
hit each one at least once. It will also prevent an opponent
from taking any other warrior out of action in the massed
combat, as they will be too concerned with the Daemon to
finish off their other enemy!
Combat: As if drawn by the sounds of clash of steel, The
Bloodletter will seek out the nearest close combat and join in.
If there are no ongoing close combats within range, it will
charge the model with the highest Weapon Skill in order to
do battle with a worthy opponent. If there are no enemies

#### Undead

Undead Special Rules
All undead have the same basic rules that they follow:
Cause Fear: Undead are terrifying creatures and therefore
cause fear.
Immune to Psychology: Undead are not affected by
psychology and never leave combat.
Immune to Poison: Undead are not affected by any poison.
May not run: Undead are slow undead creatures and may
not run (but may charge normally).

Banshee
A Banshee is a powerful Wraith, who wails constantly in battle. Her
wail brings only death and despair to those who hear it.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Banshee 8 3 0 3 4 2 3 2 8
Weapons/Armour: None
Special rules:
Body: Once the Banshee’s wound is Reduced to 0 it is
automatically out of action.
Ethereal: Can pass through any object on a successful Ld-
roll. Is immune to poison. Ignores Knocked Down and
Stunned result on the injury roll. Can only be hurt by CC-
weapons, at -1 to hit. Missile weapons pass right through the
ethereal model. Magic weapons hit as normal. The ghost can
also travel vertically, but must always come to rest on a
horizontal surface at the end of its move. The ghost cannot
run when passing through an object, and if it charges through
an object it can only move its M, not the double distance.
Also when moving horizontally it cannot double its move.
Ghostly Howl: A Banshee is capable of emitting an eerie
howl that brings death to mortals. Even the distant shriek of a
banshee is enough to strike horror into the hearts of the
bravest man, but anyone hearing the constant wail of a
Banshee will almost certainly die of sheer fright.
The Ghostly Howl of a Banshee is used in the Shooting
phase. A Banshee may use it even if engaged in hand to hand
combat, but only against the model(s) it is fighting. The
attack has a range of 8". The Banshee can target any model
within range and does not need line of sight to the model.
Roll 2D6+2 and deduct the Leadership value of the model.
For each point by which the roll beats the target’s leadership,
the target suffers one wound.
Experience
+1 For wounding the Beast. Any Hero or Henchman earns
+1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Ghost.
+1 For taking the Beast out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Ghost out of action gets a bonus +1
experience.

Ghosts
Made by McAber (Mats Carlsson), with input from the
Mordheim E-group list, especially David Stillberg.
Mordheim has many ghosts. Several that died with unfinished
business now roam the desolate streets in futile attempts to find
peace for their restless souls. Most of them are bound to specific
locations in the city, haunting burnt out buildings and ruins. Many
of the ghosts cannot do more than moan, groan and cause dread in
general. Even the more active ghosts most of the time pose no great
threat to the living. The ghost can emit a shriek that pierces the ears
and souls of the living. It will force fainthearted to run in terror
from the ghost, and make the more hardened warriors to shield their
ears and stumble away. The ghost also can draw the life-force from
a victim by touching them, but this is a fairly slow process. These
attacks are mostly non-lethal, sometimes a victim can stumble over
a ledge when fleeing from a shrieking ghost and fall to their death,
but most of the time it is enough to get away from the haunted
building to be safe.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Ghost 5 3 0 0 3 2 1 2 7
Weapons: Shriek, Cold touch, Cannot use any equipment.
Special rules
Haunt: Must be deployed within a building or ruin anywhere
on the playing field not occupied by an enemy model. Cannot
venture further than 5" from any building or ruin. (So it can
move between buildings if they are not more than 10" apart.)
Ethereal: Can pass through any object on a successful Ld-
roll. Is immune to poison. Ignores Knocked Down and
Stunned result on the injury roll. Can only be hurt by CC-
weapons, at -1 to hit. Missile weapons pass right through the
ethereal model. Magic weapons hit as normal. The ghost can
also travel vertically, but must always come to rest on a
horizontal surface at the end of its move. The ghost cannot
run when passing through an object, and if it charges through
an object it can only move its M, not the double distance.
Also when moving horizontally it cannot double its move.
Shriek: The ghost emits a soul (and ear) piercing shriek
affecting all living models (for example ghouls, dregs and
necromancers) in a 3" radius. They have to take a Ld test. If
the result is equal to or lower than the model's T, it is
unaffected altogether. If it is higher than the models T, but
not higher than it's Ld, the model staggers d3" directly from
the Ghost, clasping it's hand to it's ears. If the result is higher
than the model's Ld, it breaks and flees, just as if it failed a
Fear test. Models immune to Psychology don't break, but
staggers 1d6" instead. Only one Shriek can be made per turn,
but every extra attack spent shrieking gives +1 on the Ld roll.
Cold touch: The ghost reaches inside the enemy and touches
his inner being (it can be the soul, life-force or whatever is in
there). The ghost uses Ld instead of S to wound, and the
victim uses Ld instead of T to withstand the hit. The victim
has no armour save. Instead of causing a wound it lowers the
Toughness by 1 for the rest of the battle (accumulative). If T
reaches 0 roll on the injury table with +2 on the roll.
Experience
+1 For wounding the Beast. Any Hero or Henchman earns
+1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Ghost.
+1 For taking the Beast out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Ghost out of action gets a bonus +1
experience.

#### Monsters

Black Pegasus
It is said that a few of the Pegasi escaped the destruction and their
cages and have made their lairs around this area. Some have
mutated horribly and are twisted diabolic parodies of their former
selves. The infamous of these creatures is said to be a huge Black
Pegasus with several additional horribly mutated heads, that of a
serpent and a ram. Hunger gnaws at the stomachs of these beasts
and they will face many times their number if they catch the scent of
prey.

Young Giants
Giants are said to be forged from the earth itself. They are powerful
creatures given to rage easily and often rampage throughout the
land to deter would be adventurer. Most of the larger Giants
slumber in caves and are seldom ever seen by the eyes of man. Some
of the younger, more naive beasts are given to sleeping in the open
however, prey to monster hunters and thieves, which is of course if
the young Giant does not wake.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Young Giant 6 3 0 5 5 4 2 3 8
SPECIAL RULES
Slumbering Brute: The Young Giant is initially sleeping. In
each player’s recovery phase roll a D6, on a roll of 6 the
Young Giant awakes (add +1 to the roll for each model
within 2" of the beast, it instantly awakens if attacked). The
Giant’s turn is always before the player’s who woke it. It will
always move towards the nearest model, charging if possible
but will not attack a Truthsayer or Dark Emissary due to their
close affiliation.
Fear: Huge and obese the Young Giant causes Fear.
Enraged: Waking from its slumber the Young Giant is very
mad and will therefore not Rout for any reason.
Thick-headed: The Young Giant’s skull is as thick as a rock
and as such it can never be stunned, treat any stunned results
as knocked down instead.
Ungainly: If a Young Giant is knocked down roll a scatter
dice to determine the direction it falls in, then place the
model on its back. Any model underneath the Giant must
pass an Immediate initiative test or suffer a strength 5 hit as
the brute crushes them. The Young Giant automatically picks
itself up next turn.
Rampage: When the Young Giant attacks it is a rampage of
varied assaults. Roll a D6 to determine what it does.
1-2 Swipe. Attacks as normal.
3-4 Stomp. Makes a single attack at Strength 7 inflicting
double wounds.
5-6 Shout and Bawl. All models within 4" of the brute must

Young Hydra
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Young Hydra 6 3 0 4 4 5 3 5 8
Special Rules
Fear: Despite its smaller size, the young Hydra is still a
fearsome opponent. It causes fear.
Save: The young Hydra’s scales aren’t as strong as a normal
Hydra’s, but they are still as strong as metal. The Hydra has
an armour save of 6+ that is not modified by the strength of
attacks against it (or by other save modifiers).
Breath Weapon: When the young Hydra breathes, flames
leap from its mouths. It can use these flames as a weapon if it
wishes. This attack is made in the Shooting phase and may be
made even if the Hydra is involved in close combat. Simply
place the small teardrop shaped template with the narrow end
at one of the Hydra’s mouths; any models under the template
will be hit by flames on a dice roll of 4+. A model hit by
flames takes a single S3 hit. Normal armour saves apply. Do
not worry about any buildings the template may cover; the
Hydra’s fire is too weak to set them alight without prolonged
exposure.
Loss of Heads: Each wound suffered by a Hydra represents
one of its many heads getting taken out of action. Because of
this, any successful (unsaved and un-regenerated) Wound to a
Hydra reduces its Attacks characteristic by one. In addition,
the loss of heads makes for fewer flames when it breathes, so
for every 2 successful Wounds, the strength of the Hydra’s
breath weapon is reduced by one (to a minimum Strength of
1). So, for example, if the Hydra has taken 3 (unsaved and
unregenerated) Wounds, it would have 2 attacks remaining
and the Strength of its breath weapon would be reduced to 2.
Regeneration: All Hydras have the ability to regrow
damaged heads. Some can do this immediately, while for
others it may take a matter of hours or even days to replace a
head that is lost. To represent this ability, at the end of each
round of close combat roll a D6 for each Wound the Hydra
has suffered that round. On a roll of 4 or more that Wound
has regenerated; any regenerated Wounds are reinstated. If a
Hydra is down to its last Wound remaining, make this roll to
regenerate before rolling on the Injury table; a successful
Regenerate roll means that no Injury roll is made.
Will not Rout: The Hydra is far too greedy to abandon its
hoard. It will automatically pass any Rout test or any other
test that would cause it to leave its lair. It will not leave its
lair for any reason.
Skull of Iron: The Hydra’s skulls are much too thick for
normal blows to penetrate. It is immune to the effects of
being stunned. Treat any stunned results from the Injury table
as a knocked down result instead (see below).
Staggered, but not down: Mighty blows will rock the Hydra
but most creatures lack the ability to truly knock it into the
dirt. Therefore, any knocked down result the Hydra receives
will instead cause it to lose 1 Attack until it recovers (during
the Recovery phase of its next turn). Multiple knocked down
results will cause it to lose multiple attacks in this way (if
taken to 0 Attacks or fewer, the Hydra may not attack until it
recovers).

```
Experience
+1 For wounding the Monster. Any Hero or Henchman
earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Young
Hydra.
+2 For taking the Monster out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Young Hydra out of action gets a
bonus +2 experience.

Dragon’s, but they are still as strong as metal. The young
Dragon has an Armour save of 5+ that is not modified by the
strength of attacks against it (or by other save modifiers).
Breath Weapon: When the young Dragon breathes, flames
leap from its mouth. It can use these flames as a weapon if it
wishes. This attack is made in the Shooting phase, and may
be made even if the Dragon is involved in close combat.
Simply place the small teardrop shaped template supplied
opposite with the narrow end at the Dragon’s mouth. Any
models under the template will be hit by flames on a dice roll
of 4+. A model hit by flames takes a single S3 hit. Normal
armour saves apply. Do not worry about any buildings the
template may cover; the Dragon’s fire is too weak to set them
alight without prolonged exposure.

Save: The Wyvern’s scales aren’t as strong as a normal
Wyvern’s, but they are still as strong as metal. The Wyvern
has an armour save 6+ that is not modified by the strength of
attacks against it (or other save modifiers).
Envenomed Tail: The Wyvern has a whip-like tail that is
tipped with a deadly stinger. In combat it thrashes this tail
forward among its enemies, either injecting them with its
deadly venom, or simply clubbing them into submission. In
game terms this is represented by a special tail strike that the
Wyvern makes before its normal attacks in close combat.
Roll a D6. Any enemy models that are in base contact with
the Wyvern and that it may attack in the Close Combat phase
(e.g., it is either the Wyvern’s ‘turn’ or the model’s turn) that
have a lower Initiative than the dice score are automatically
hit by the Wyvern’s tail. Models with Initiative equal to or
higher than the D6 roll have successfully dodged the tail and
are not affected. Each model struck by the Wyvern’s tail
takes a Strength 4 hit.
Will not Rout: The Wyvern is far too greedy to abandon its

test that would cause it to leave its lair. It will not leave its

### Optional Rules

This section includes a variety of rules that add an extra
dimension to your battles in Mordheim. As they are additions
to the basic rules they are not an essential part of the game,
and you should agree with your opponent beforehand
whether you are going to use any of them.
We recommend that new players ignore this section to begin
with, at least until you are familiar with the way the game
works. If you consider yourself to be an experienced gamer
then you’ll have no problem incorporating these elements.
Some of these additional rules alter the game quite
dramatically, and you are under no obligation to use any of
them. They have simply been included for players who want
to explore different aspects of the game.

#### New critical hit charts

Depending on what weapon your warrior is using, you may roll on one of the following Critical Hit charts. For example, if
your warrior is using a sword, roll on the Bladed Weapons chart. All the rules governing critical hits given in the main rules
also apply to these tables.

##### Missile weapons

(Bows, crossbows, blackpowder weapons, throwing knives etc.)
1-2 Hits a Weak Spot. The missile penetrates its target’s armour.
Ignore all armour saves.
3-4 Ricochet. If there are any other models within 6", the closest
enemy model is also hit. Roll to wound and take any saves as
normal for both targets.
5-6 Master Shot. The missile hits an eye, the throat, or some other
vulnerable part. The target suffers 2 wounds instead of 1. There is
no armour save.

##### Bludgeoning weapons

(Clubs, maces, hammers, flails, double-handed hammers etc.)
1-2 Hammered. The target is knocked off balance. Your opponent
may not fight this turn if he hasn’t already fought.
3-4 Clubbed. The hit ignores armour saves and saves from helmets.
5 Wild Sweep. Your opponent’s weapon is knocked from his hand.
If he is carrying two weapons, roll to see which one he loses. He
must fight with whatever back-up weapon he has in his equipment
for the rest of this combat (or fight unarmed if he has no other
weapons). Roll to wound and take armour saves as normal.
6 Bludgeoned. The victim automatically goes out of action if he fails
his armour save. Even if he has several wounds remaining, he will
be taken out of action by this attack.

##### Bladed weapons

(Swords, axes, double-handed swords etc.)
1-2 Flesh Wound. This attack hits an unprotected area, so there is no
armour save.
3-4 Bladestorm. The warrior unleashes a virtual hail of blows. The
attack causes 2 wounds instead of 1. Take armour saves separately
for each wound. Remember that, as with other critical hits, if an
attack causes multiple wounds for other reasons as well, you choose
the highest number of wounds.
5-6 Sliced! The strike ignores armour saves, causes 2 wounds, and
your warrior gains +2 to any Injury rolls.

##### Unarmed combat

```
(War dogs, warhorses, Zombies, Possessed, animals etc.)
1-2 Body Blow. Your opponent staggers, allowing you to seize the
initiative and make an additional attack. Immediately roll to hit and
to wound. Any saves are taken as normal.
3-4 Crushing Blow. The blow lands with tremendous force. You
gain +1 to the Injury roll if your opponent fails his save.
5-6 Mighty Blow. With a mighty punch or flying kick, you send
your opponent sprawling to the ground. The attack ignores armour
saves and you gain +2 to any Injury rolls.
```
##### Thrusting weapons

```
(Spears, halberds, lances etc.)
1-2 Stab. With a quick strike, you penetrate your opponent’s
defences. You gain +1 to any Injury rolls. Armour saves are taken as
normal.
3-4 Thrust. The thrust lands with great force and the target is
knocked down. Take armour saves as normal and see whether the
model suffers a wound.
5-6 Kebab! The thrust knocks the target back with titanic force,
ripping apart armour and puncturing flesh. The attack ignores
armour saves and you gain +2 to any Injury rolls. The victim is
knocked backwards D6" and the attacker follows, staying in base
contact. Any other models involved in the combat are separated and
only the model which struck the blow and his target are still
considered to be in combat. If the target collides with another
model, the other model is hit once at S3.
```

#### Escaping from combat

Warriors that are engaged in hand-to-hand combat at the start
of their own turn may try to escape from combat during their
movement phase. Such fighters are assumed to have realised
that the odds are against them and decided that it is just too
dangerous for them to continue.
Declare which of your warriors will try to escape from
combat at the start of your movement phase, at the same time
as you declare charges. Turn the models around to show this.
Take a Leadership test for each warrior trying to escape from
combat. This represents his efforts to find the right time to
escape. If he passes, the warrior can move up to double his
normal Movement rate away from combat and the enemy he
was fighting, in any direction.

```
If he fails, his opponent is allowed to make 1 automatic hit
against the warrior who is trying to escape, and the fleeing
warrior (provided he survives) will run 2D6" directly away
from combat. He will have to take a Leadership test at the
beginning of his next turn.
If successful he will stop, but may not do anything else
during that turn. If the test is failed, he will continue to run
2D6" towards the closest table edge and must test again the
following turn if he is still on the table.
If a warrior is charged whilst he is fleeing, the charger is
moved into base contact with him as normal, but the fleeing
warrior will then immediately run a further 2D6" towards the
table edge, before any blows can be struck.
```
#### Rewards of the Shadowlord

When a Magister or Mutant from a Possessed warband has accumulated enough experience, instead of picking a skill,
he may roll on the Rewards table below. This represents the pilgrimage of the Mutant or Magister to the Pit, where he
can beseech a favour from the Shadowlord himself. Roll 2D6.
2 Wrath of the Shadowlord! The warrior is mutated
beyond recognition and vanishes into the ruins,
joining the many other horrors that roam Mordheim.
3-6 Nothing Happens. The capricious Shadowlord
ignores the pleas of his servant.
7-8 Mutation. The warrior develops a severe mutation.
Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 you lose a single point from
one of your warrior’s characteristics (chosen by
you), due to atrophy, or some such degrading
mutation. On a roll of 2 or more you may choose
which one of the mutations listed in the Cult of the
Possessed Warbands section your warrior has been
rewarded with.
9-10 Chaos Armour. The warrior’s body becomes
encrusted with an arcane, all enveloping suit of
armour. This confers a basic 4+ save, but does not
affect the model’s ability to cast spells or move in
any way.

```
11 Daemon Weapon. The warrior receives a weapon
with a bound Daemon inside it. This weapon adds
+1 to his Strength in close combat, grants a +1
bonus on all to hit rolls using it. The user may
choose the weapon’s form (a sword, an axe, etc),
though it will not have any of the special abilities
normally associated with common weapons of that
type. An axe with a bound Daemon, for example,
will not benefit from the usual extra save modifier.
12 Possessed! A Daemon takes over the soul and body
of the warrior. He immediately gains +1 Weapon
Skill, +1 Strength, +1 Attacks and +1 Wounds.
These increases do not count towards his maximum
characteristics. The warrior loses D3 of his skills
(chosen by the player) and may no longer use
weapons or armour, except for Chaos Armour or
Daemon weapons.

#### Mounted Warriors

By Robert J. Walker and Roger Latham
Horses are rare and expensive in Mordheim, but they do allow warriors to move quickly, so as long as the steed stays on the
streets and does not venture into the ruined buildings, where it could easily stumble and fall. By using the following rules, you
can include mounted Heroes in your games.

##### Model Representation

If you wish to include riding beasts or tamed animals you
will need to have models to represent them. For mounted
warriors you will need both a mounted miniature and a model
on foot. It is advised not to glue the rider on but to use ‘blue-
tack’ or something similar so that he may be removed when
on foot and his mount is unridden.

##### Riding Animals

Most warriors in Mordheim can only dream of owning a
riding animal. Expensive to buy, expensive to keep and
requiring skill to ride, they are a mark of status beyond the
reach of lowly henchmen. To those with the necessary wealth
and skill, however, they are a priceless possession, enabling
their rider to move rapidly across the battlefield, aiding him
in combat with an advantage of height and weight, and in
some cases, fighting in their own right.

##### Mounted models in Mordheim

A warrior and his horse are treated in all respects as a single
model. Should the rider be taken out of action, then the entire
model is removed from the battle.
Mounted warriors use the rider’s Leadership value for all
Leadership-based tests. When the warrior is attacked, use the
rider’s Toughness and Wounds.
In close combat, a warhorse can make 1 attack, but a normal
horse has no Attacks characteristic and therefore does not
attack in close combat.
Armour, called barding, may be purchased for a warhorse,
(refer to the Trading chart). It adds a further +1 bonus to the
model’s armour save, but subtracts one from its Movement.
A normal horse may not wear barding. A barded warhorse is
only killed on a serious injury roll of ‘1’ if the model goes
out of action.

##### Special Rules

Mounting Animals: It requires a full move to mount or
dismount a riding creature and the rider may not shoot or cast
magic whilst doing so. A mount or its rider may not run or
charge in the same turn that the warrior mounts or dismounts
unless the rider has a Cavalry Skill that allows this.
Not Indoors: Mounts cannot normally be ridden indoors or
underground, unless playing a specially devised scenario that
allows this.
Dense Terrain: Riding mounts are rare both amongst the
ruins of Mordheim and in the claustrophobic jungles of
Lustria. The dense terrain makes riding difficult and large
numbers of riders are highly ineffective. Thus in those
settings a warband may only have a maximum of two mounts
(not including those belonging to Hired Swords). In more
open settings, such as the open fields in the countryside
around Mordheim or the deserts of Khemri, a warband may
have as many mounts as they can afford.
Controlling a Mount: The Cavalry Skills may be used by
warriors who have a riding animal, but only after the skill
Ride has been gained; warriors which come provided with a
riding animal are assumed to possess the Ride skill already.

```
Warriors without this skill may still ride animals, but must
test against their Leadership if hit by any missile and at the
beginning of any combat phase when a standing enemy is in
base contact. If the test is failed they lose control of their
mount and must roll on the Whoa, Boy! Table (see below).
Note if an enemy is not standing, the mounted warrior is not
considered to be in combat and thus does not need to test for
loss of control.
Two Weapon Fighting: Mounted warriors may not fight
with two weapons, although a shield or buckler may be used
as normal. Two-handed weapons are not permitted. The use
of a pistol in the first round of hand-to-hand combat replaces
the model’s usual weapon.
Armour Bonus: All riding animals give their riders a +1
armour save bonus.
Bolting Mounts: In certain circumstances, a mount may bolt.
A bolting mount must make a Leadership test at the
beginning of the owning player’s turn; if successful it stops
running, otherwise it continues fleeing. The easiest way to
determine the direction a mount bolts is to use an scatter dice.
If you do not have one, then roll 2D6 and use the clock-face
method. Taking the direction the horse is facing as 12 and
directly behind as 6, the horse will bolt in the appropriate
direction on the clock-face.
Stunned Riders: Stunned riders will fall from their mounts
as indicated on the Whoa Boy! Table. Mounts which
subsequently bolt may be remounted should the warrior make
base contact with the horse before it leaves the table. Note
that whether the mount leaves the table or not, it will be
recovered unscathed after the battle.
Leading Animals: On occasion, a warrior may want to lead
a riding animal rather than riding it. A warrior may only lead
one riding animal unless he has the Animal Handling skill,
for that particular animal, in which case he can lead as many
as he wishes. Groups of led animals are tethered together and
must maintain base contact with each other; at least one must
be in base contact with the warrior leading them. Riding
animals that are being led do not roll for loss of control. If
required to make a Leadership test (e.g. when attacked by a
fear causing enemy) they use the Ld of the warrior leading
them. A warrior leading riding animals may move and fight
as normal, but must maintain base contact at all times.
Unled Animals: Riding animals which are not being either
led or ridden will remain stationary but must make a
Leadership test at the beginning of their turn. If this is failed,
they will bolt, using the rules above.
Jumping: A horse or warhorse may jump over an obstacle up
to 2" in height with no movement penalty.
Shooting at mounted warriors: Because of the size of a
mounted warrior, any shooter may always pick one as a
target, even if there are enemies closer.
Targeting Mounted Warriors: Enemies may not target a
ridden horse, whether by missiles or in hand-to-hand combat.
The rider will always be seen as the greater threat. Due to
their prominence, any mounted warrior may always be
```
Assembled By Paul H Page 293 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


chosen as a target by a shooter even if there are enemies
closer. However the shooters do NOT gain +1 to hit - the
rider is still the same size as before.
Mounts and campaigns: If a mounted warrior is taken out of
action, roll a D6 after the battle. On a 1-2, the mount is killed
and removed from the warband roster.

##### Losing Control

If a mounted warrior is wounded, then the player must roll on
the Whoa Boy! Table. This replaces the normal injuries chart.
If critical hits are suffered then roll as many times as are
required, taking the most serious result.

##### Whoa Boy! Table

```
1-2 The rider is temporarily disorientated and his mount rears
up. The rider keeps his seat but must spend his next turn
stationary regaining control, unable to move or shoot. If
attacked, treat the rider as fallen down.
3-4 The rider falls off his mount and is stunned, taking an
additional S2 hit in the process with no armour save. In
addition, roll 1D6: on a roll of 1-3, the mount immediately
bolts 3D6" in a random direction and continues until it has
left the table – the mount may be recovered after the battle;
on a roll of 4-6, the mount remains stationary and the
warrior may remount once recovered. Note: the mount does
not count as unridden or unled in this instance.
5-6 The rider and his mount crash to the ground together. The
rider and mount are automatically out of action. In addition,
roll a D6: on a roll of 1-2 the mount lands on top of its rider,
crushing him. If this happens the warrior must roll twice on
the serious injuries chart after the battle. In addition, after
the battle roll a D6: on a roll of 1-2 the mount was crippled
or killed by the fall and removed from the warband roster.

#### Vehicles of the Empire

From The Empire in Flames
There are three principal modes of transport in the Empire: travel by boat, by riding animals, such as horses and mules, and
travel by wagon or coach. Riding animals have already been covered above. Here we will cover the rules for travel via boat
and wagon.

##### Wagons

This covers carts, stagecoaches and all two- and four-wheeled
forms of transport commonly found in the Empire.
Movement
A wagon’s movement is determined by how laden it is with
passengers and cargo. Therefore throughout a game, a
wagon’s move may alter due to unloading or loading up of
more passengers and cargo. Consult the table below to
determine movement. Wagons cannot charge, climb, hide,
run or flee.
Turns
Wagons, regardless of size, may make a single turn of up to
45 degrees at the end of its movement. It may then apply the
lash if desired. Make turns by pivoting the vehicle from its
mid-point.
Applying the Lash!
There are many reasons why a wagon driver would want to
urge his beasts to go faster – if he is being pursued by bandits
or mutants, for example! By applying the lash to his draft
beasts, the driver of a wagon can attempt to gain some extra
movement. After the wagon has moved normally, the player
may roll a D6. On the score of 2+ this indicates how many
extra inches the wagon may move ahead in a straight line. On
the roll of a 1 something drastic has happened. Roll on the
table below:
D6 Result
1-2 Steeds Tiring – The draft animals are growing tired – if the
driver applies the lash next turn you must halve the score
rounding fractions up.
3-4 Driver Shaken – Due to the wagon’s speed the driver is
thrown all over the place and may not apply the lash next
turn as he recovers his composure.
5-6 Out of control – Make a roll on the Out of Control
Wagon Movement
No. of passengers / cargo quota Applying the lash!
Standard Movement
1 (driver – compulsory) 10 +D6
2-3 8 +D6
4-6 6 +D6

Terrain
Difficult Ground: If a wagon enters difficult ground roll a
D6. On a score of a 1 immediately make a roll on the Out of
Control table, otherwise the wagon is fine.
Very Difficult Ground: If a wagon enters very difficult
ground immediately make a roll on the Out of Control table
with a modifier of +1.
Walls/Obstacles: If a wagon collides with a wall or other
solid obstacle it comes to an immediate halt. The wagon
suffers D3 hits at a Strength of 7 (see below).
Impassable Ground: If a wagon moves onto impassable
ground it is immediately destroyed and each crew
member/draft animal must make an Injury roll. Remove the
wagon and place any surviving crew within 3" of the crash
site.

```
Collisions
If a wagon collides with another wagon both suffer D3
Strength 7 hits (roll location and damage as normal below).
In the case that either attackers or defenders block the way of
a wagon and it cannot move around them then the wagon will
move through the models, even if they are from the defending
warband. All of the models touched by a wagon that is forced
to move through them must roll lower or equal to their
Initiative or suffer a S4 hit with all of the consequences.
Warriors that are out of action cannot get out of the way of a
wagon and are therefore automatically hit. Whenever a
wagon collides with anything roll a D6, on a score of a 1
make an Out of Control test.
Transport
For the sake of simplicity all wagons and coaches may
transport up to six human-sized warriors or smaller (let’s be
having no Ogre wagoneers now!) or the equivalent in cargo
(this will be covered in greater detail in the Scenarios
section). One crewman must be allocated as the driver and
one may ‘ride shotgun’ with him. The driver may do nothing
else but drive whilst the wagon is moving as he is too busy
controlling the reins. In the event that the driver is knocked
down, stunned or taken out of action a crew member riding
shotgun may take over the reins and become the new driver.
Mounting/Dismounting
A friendly warrior may board a stationary wagon by simply
moving into contact with it (wagons are only considered
stationary if they didn’t move in their last turn). Place the
model either on the wagon or move it with the wagon in base
contact to simulate it being transported. Similarly, a warrior
may dismount from a stationary wagon by moving away
from contact. Warriors may attempt to mount or dismount
from a moving wagon by passing an Initiative test. If they
fail, they take falling damage of D3 automatic hits at a
Strength equal to half the vehicle’s speed. Warriors may
attempt to board a moving wagon from either another moving
wagon or from a moving mount with a modifier of -1 to their
Initiative test – this counts as a charge.
Losing Control of the Draft Animals
Apart from if a wagon becomes a runaway, control may also
be lost by attackers attempting to wrestle away the control of
the draft animals from the driver. Apart from eliminating the
driver and taking control of the reins, the easiest way to
control the draft animals is for a warrior to leap onto the back
of one and ride it. A warrior can successfully leap onto a draft
animal by passing an Initiative test (the warrior may add +1 if
they have the Ride skill). If the test is failed then the warrior
takes falling damage as usual. The warrior must pass a
Leadership test to control the beast and therefore control the
direction and speed of the wagon. The driver can only wrestle
back control of the wagon by eliminating the warrior (any
injury will suffice). If a warrior has successfully mounted a
draft animal he may attempt to cut it free from the team on a
4+ although he will lose control of the wagon itself in doing
so.

Shooting
Shooting from a wagon: Crew may fire from aboard a
wagon and have a 360 degree arc of fire. Shooters suffer a
penalty of -1 to hit for firing from a moving surface.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Wagon - - - - 8 4 - - -
Wheel - - - - 6 1 - - -
Horse 8 - - 3 3 1 3 - -
Horse 6 - - 3 3 1 2 - -
Shooting at a wagon: Warriors may shoot at a vehicle and
gain a +1 to hit because it is a large target. If a hit is scored
against a wagon then a roll must be made on the Location
table opposite to decide what part of the vehicle has been hit.
Loss of a Draft Creature
Any time a steed is hit, regardless of whether or not it is
injured, make a roll on the Out of Control table. If a steed is
stunned or knocked down it will be dragged along by its
associates until it recovers – next turn reduce speed by 1/2
(with a draft of two animals) or 1/4 (with a draft of four
animals) and the driver may not apply the lash. If the steed is
taken out of action then permanently reduce the speed by the
previous amount until the driver can cut the animal free on
the roll of a 5+. If the last steed is stunned, knocked down or
taken out of action then the wagon comes to a halt and cannot
move unless the steed recovers – make an Out of Control roll
with +2 to the result.

```
Out of Control
D6 Result
1-3 Swerve – The driver temporarily loses control and the
wagon veers wildly off course. Roll a D6:
1-3 – Swerves 45 degrees to the left.
4-6 – Swerves 45 degrees to the right.
The wagon then moves another 6" in the predetermined
direction.
4-5 Runaway – The steeds bolt and the driver loses control of
them. Each turn randomly determine the direction that the
wagon goes in. Roll a D6:
1-2 – Swerves 45 degrees to the left.
3-4 – Swerves 45 degrees to the right.
5-6 – moves straight ahead.
The wagon will always move at full speed and roll for
applying the lash discounting the effects of a 1 all the time it
is a runaway. Each turn the driver may attempt to take
control of the steeds. The driver must pass a Leadership test
to regain control of the beasts. The crew may not fire missile
weapons all the time the wagon is a runaway as they are
trying to hold on for dear life.
6 Loss of control – The wagon goes wildly out of control.
Roll a D6:
1 – The wagon swerves to the right (see above).
2 – The wagon swerves to the left (see above).
3-4 – The wagon comes to an immediate halt.
5 – The wagon’s yoke pole snaps and the draft animals
gallop off. The vehicle moves 6" straight ahead and then
comes to a halt. The vehicle may no longer move.
6 – The wagon either jack-knifes or hits a rock or a
depression in the road and goes into a roll! The wagon
moves D6" in a random direction determined by the
Artillery Scatter dice. Any warriors/beasts it collides with
take the usual collision damage. All the crew and draft
animals take D3 Strength 4 hits. The wagon is now wrecked.
Wagon Location
D6 Result
1-2 Draft creature – Roll to wound and injure as normal – see
loss of draft creature below for effects.
3 Crew– Randomly select a crew member and roll to wound
and injure as normal – see Loss of Driver overleaf if
applicable. Any crew member that is wounded must make
an immediate Initiative test – if this is failed he has fallen
from the wagon and must test for falling damage.
4-5 Chassis – Roll to damage the vehicle using the stat line
below.
6 Wheel – Roll to damage the wheel using the stat-line below.
Wheel Damage
D6 Result
1-4 Wheel damaged – The wagon’s speed is permanently reduced
by -2".
5-6 Wheel flies off! – The wagon immediately swerves (see the
swerve result on the Out of Control table above) and then comes to a
halt. The wagon is now immobile. Roll a D6, on the score of 5-6 the
wagon goes into a roll (see the roll result on the Out of Control table
above).
```

Wheel Damage: If a wheel is damaged this is potentially
disastrous. Randomly determine which wheel has been
damaged and roll on the table above adding +1 to the result if
the wheel has been damaged before.
Chassis Damage: When the wagon loses its final point of
damage/wound it is destroyed, comes to an immediate halt
and each crew member/draft animal must make an Injury roll.
Combat
Warriors may strike a stationary wagon in close combat by
charging and striking against the part they are in contact with
(draft creatures / crew / wheel / chassis).
Chassis/wheels: Attacks hit automatically – just resolve
damage.
Crew: Crew on board a stationary wagon are counted as
defending an obstacle and a 6 is required to hit them
regardless of Weapon Skill. If a crew member is taken out of
action an attacker may enter/board the wagon in his next turn.
Draft Animals: The draft animals may be attacked in the
usual manner although an attacker may choose to cut the
draft animals free instead which requires a 2+ on a D6 to be
successful. Draft animals that are cut free count as un-led
beasts (see above).

```
Warriors may attempt to attack a moving wagon by charging
it in the normal way. Note: Charging a moving wagon does
not bring it to a halt – the combat round is played out and
then the wagon is free to move in its next Movement phase –
if it is a runaway then it is compelled to move. Warriors are
advised to attack to the side and rear because if they attack to
the front they are liable to be run down in the wagon’s next
turn! Because attacking a moving wagon is a haphazard affair
the attacker must determine the location struck first by rolling
on the Location table above. Both the chassis and wheels are
hit automatically just resolve damage. The draft animals are
attacked in the normal manner although an attacker may not
attempt to cut the reins on moving draft animals. The crew
are difficult to strike and therefore a 6 is require to hit them
regardless of Weapon Skill.
If the attackers manage to successfully board the wagon
either when it was stationary or by leaping aboard it as it was
moving they may engage the crew in combat in the usual
manner without any penalties or modifiers. Note: Attackers
or defenders that are injured fighting aboard a wagon must
pass an Initiative test or fall off.
```
##### Boats

This covers small rowing boats through to large river barges.
Note that these are very basic rules to cover small skirmishes
on the rivers of the Empire, a more inclusive set of rules to
cover ocean-going ships is currently in development.
Movement
Boats move 6" when moving with the current of a river (the
direction of the river flow must be established before the start
of the game). Boats may move 4" when travelling against the
current. Boats must move at least half of their movement
allowance unless they have been anchored or tethered to the
shore.
Turns
Boats, regardless of size, may make a single turn of up to 45
degrees at the end of their movement.
Terrain
A boat can encounter natural terrain such as rocks or
manmade obstacles such as logjams specifically placed to
obstruct its movement. Both the aforementioned terrain types
are impassable to boats and they will suffer D3 Strength 7
hits should they move into them and also come to an
immediate halt.
Collision
If a boat collides with another boat both suffer D3 Strength 7
hits (roll location and damage as normal below). In the case
that either attackers or defenders block the way of a boat and
it cannot move around them then the boat will move through
the models, even if they are from the defending warband. All
of the models touched by a boat that is forced to move
through them must roll lower or equal to their Initiative or
suffer a S4 hit with all of the consequences. Warriors that are
out of action cannot get out of the way of a wagon and are
therefore automatically hit. Whenever a boat collides with
anything roll a D6, on a score of a 1 make an Out of Control
test.

```
Transport
All the above rules for wagons apply. In addition, because
boats are considerably bigger than wagons, they can therefore
transport a lot more.
A rowboat can transport up to six human-sized warriors or
smaller, or the equivalent in cargo.
A river boat can transport up to eight human-sized warriors
or smaller, or the equivalent in cargo.
A barge can transport up to twelve human-sized warriors or
smaller, or the equivalent in cargo.
Mounting/Dismounting
See above for wagons, except warriors that fail an Initiative
test for attempting to board a moving boat do not suffer
damage but fall into the water – see the rules for swimming.
Shooting
Shooting from a wagon: Crew may fire from aboard a boat
and have a 360 degree arc of fire. Shooters suffer a penalty of
-1 to hit for firing from a moving surface.
Shooting at a wagon: Warriors may shoot at a vehicle and
gain a +1 to hit because it is a large target. If a hit is scored
against a boat then a roll must be made on the Location table
opposite to decide what part of the vehicle has been hit.

the case of an oared vessel) the boat may only drift 2" in the
direction of the current. All crew must immediately test on
their Initiative to avoid the falling mast (this does not apply
to oared vessels obviously). If a crewman fails this test he
receives an immediate Strength 6 hit.
Hull Damage: When the boat loses its final point of
damage/wound it is destroyed and sinks immediately. Each
crew member falls into the water and must make the
appropriate tests for swimming.
Combat
See wagons above. Note: Swimming warriors may not attack
boats!

#### Blackpowder weapons

During the period in which Mordheim is set, the technology
needed to make blackpowder weapons was still rare, and
pistols, handguns, blunderbusses, etc were prone to
malfunctions, jams and misfires.
The following rules were not included in the Shooting
section, as they would have slowed down the game, but if
you want to create more realistic games, feel free to use the
Misfire rules below.
If you do use these rules, you might want to reduce the cost
of the weapons (we suggest by 20%) to keep the balance of
the game fair.

##### Misfires

Each time you roll a 1 when rolling to hit with a blackpowder
weapon (handgun, pistol, blunderbuss, warplock pistol, etc),
roll a D6 and consult the chart below.

##### Blackpowder Weapons Misfires

```
1 BOOM! The weapon explodes with a deafening roar! The
shooter suffers an S4 hit (this does not cause critical hits)
and the weapon is destroyed.
2 Jammed. The weapon is jammed and useless for the
remainder of the battle. You may use it as normal in the
next battle.
3 Phut. The weapon fails to fire and you must remove the
shot. This means that the shooter must wait one extra turn
before he can fire this weapon again.
4-5 Click. The weapon fails to fire, but there is no additional
effect.
6 KA-BOOM! The weapon roars and spits a cloud of black
smoke and flame! The shot hits the intended target and
counts as having +1 Strength.
```
#### Fighting individual battles

One thing we discovered during play testing Mordheim was
that after a while very experienced warbands became
virtually unbeatable when fighting against novice warbands.
Whilst this might be amusing for the player with the
experienced warband, it will result in a very one-sided
battle, where the inexperienced warband is swiftly crushed,
without even a chance to put up a decent fight. Although the
underdogs system balances this out somewhat, it is often
much more fun to play with roughly equal forces, especially
when introducing new players to the game.
The following rules allow both players to pick warbands up
to an agreed equal value, say 1,000 gold crowns. This will
make the game much more even, as the two forces will be
roughly similar in strength. Use the Warband lists to recruit
and equip your warband. The lists tell you which Heroes,
Henchmen and equipment your warband is allowed to use.
The limitations of the list ensure that the warbands are
reasonably balanced.
You must recruit at least three warriors, including a leader,
and you may either follow the limitations for the maximum
size of a warband given in the list or agree a maximum size
with your opponent.

##### Weapons & armour

Each Hero you recruit may be armed with one or more
weapons and any armour chosen from the appropriate list.
Different types of Hero are restricted to different types of
weapon. The Equipment lists for the individual warbands tell
you exactly what equipment is available. You may buy rare
weapons and armour. Pay the appropriate prices for these as
given in the Trading charts.
Every model in each Henchman group must take exactly the
same weapons and armour. This means that if your
Henchman group has four warriors, and you want to buy
them swords, you must buy four swords.

```
The weapons you choose for your warriors must be
represented on the models. This way your opponent will
know what he is facing (and he will not be shocked to
discover in the middle of the game that the warrior who looks
like a Halfling with a bow is in fact an Ogre with a club!).
The exceptions to this rule are knives and daggers, which you
may assume are tucked in boots or concealed in their clothes,
if not actually represented on the model.
```
##### Upgrading heroes

```
In a campaign game, you must earn statistic increases, but in
one-off games they can be bought beforehand. You may
increase the starting characteristics of your Heroes by paying
the cost in gold crowns given below.
Note that all races have maximum statistics values. These can
be found in the Experience section of this rulebook.
Movement +15gc per point.
Weapon Skill +15gc per point.
Ballistic Skill +15gc per point.
Strength +25gc for the first increase/+35gc for each
additional increase.
Toughness +30gc for the first increase/+45gcfor each
additional increase.
Wounds +20gc for the first increase/+30gc for each
additional increase.
Initiative +10gc per point.
Attacks +25 GC for the first increase/+35gc for
each additional increase.
Leadership +15gc per point.
Skills +40gc for each skill. You may choose one
skill at this price for each characteristic
increase you take. Choose from the skills
normally available to your warrior.
```
##### Ready for battle

```
The warband is now ready to fight against your opponent.

#### Night Fights

By Donato Ranzato & Chris Van Tighem
The night surrounded them like a blanket of darkness, and
Yarri felt like he was wading in an sea of black. The nights at
Mordheim are bitterly cold, and so dark the darkness seems
to suck in and engulf all light. The monsters too, seem to
favour the night, and the unexpected happens more than any
warband leader would like.
Yarri sat hushed next to his old friend, his handgun cocked
and ready to blow away towards any sound he heard. He
jumped as a hand touched his shoulder, but soon he calmed
his mind thinking it was only Grum trying to gather his
bearings. However, his calm nerves lasted only a second
longer as the grip tightend and long claws dug into his
shoulder.
Yarri cried out for help, but all he received was a strangled
cry emanating from the darkness and a brutal blow the
head...

##### Summary of rules:

All missile weapons firing at short range are at -1 to hit, and
at long range -2 to hit.
All psychology tests (Fear, All Alone, etc,) are taken with a -
1 modifier to Ld. This represents the increased unease of
combatants in the dark.
Fighters with all types of bows have the option of using
Flaming arrows which they may search for and purchase
prior to the game beginning instead of after the fight.
However some restrictions do apply. The model moves at -1
to its movement since braziers have to be carried in order to
light the arrows. All attacks from flaming arrows count as
flammable attacks and will cause double wounds on
flammable creatures.

```
Creatures immune to psychology will be unaffected by
darkness modifiers for psychology tests and will not flee
faster. They simply shrug off the eerie effects of the darkness.
The night is the time for wild and powerful magic. All
spellcasters (except for those who uses prayers) benefit from
a +1 to casting for the duration of battle. However, if a
Wizard rolls doubles while casting they must immediately
roll a D6. If the result of the roll is 1 the model is
immediately taken out of action, if a 2 or 3 is rolled than the
wizard has lost the ability to cast for the remainder of the
battle and a roll of 4-6 no ill effects occur.
A cavalry charges causes fear representing the visual and
psychological impact of a cavalry charge from out of the
gloom. However, if a one is rolled on the attack than the
mounted figure must make an initiative check or be thrown
from their mount (the mount had unsteady footing). The
falling warrior takes a d3 Str.2 wounds and the mount,
spooked by the fall will run off 3d6 inches away from the
combat.
While no creature can see in the dark there are a few that
have adapted to life in darkenss. Through their use of smell,
touch or some supernatural ability they tend to have an easier
time after the sun sets than most. Any Skaven, Dwarf,
Undead, or Beastmen may, once per turn reroll any result
once. The second roll stands and if a one is rolled on the
reroll than that warrior loses the benefit of the reroll for the
remainder of the game.
Note: If you are using the optional rule of random events -
they now occur on a 1 or 2, instead of just 1.
```
#### The Catacombs

By Donato Ranzato
"I would not look at the marching things. That I desperately resolved as I heard their cracking joints and nitrous wheezing
above the dead music and the dread tramping. It was merciful that they did not speak... but by Sigmar! Their crazy torches
began to cast shadows on the surface of those stupendous columns. Foulness should not have human hands and carry
torches... living creatures should not have the heads of sheer insanity..." - Last page of the diary of Magnus Faustlich, also
known as Magnus the Fearless
What most people in Mordheim don't know, is that far below
the sewers there are tunnels that were old even before
Mordheim existed. They were there before Sigmar was born,
and they could even be there before the Slann arrived. The
Skaven have known of these ancient subterranean tunnels for
years as they have found openings to these deeper regions
during their excavations of the sewers below the city. And
what they found there scared them more then the cursed city
above them. They know that there is something truly evil
waiting in these primordial catacombs. Something older then
the earth, maybe even older then the universe. And the
meteor woke it up...

##### Exploring the Catacombs

Far below the earth the silence is ceaseless and oppressive. A
terrible impression of the huge weight of suspended stone and
earth is forced upon anyone who enters. Occasional gusts of
wind pass down the main tunnel, causing candles and torches
to gutter momentarily. There is no light, except for an
occasional glow from livid purple or putrid green fungi -
slimy stuff disgusting to touch. Side tunnels and tiny votary

```
alcoves frequently open to either side. Along the main tunnel,
loathsome images panel the walls, depicting men with the
heads of animals, animals with human limbs, and alien
entities performing cruel, disgusting, and obscene rituals.
Some parts of these black passages are obviously cut from
the stone; other parts look like old watercourses or rock
fractures; other parts look as if acids had eaten through the
stone; still other parts have obviously been hacked clear by
alien tooth and claw.
It looks like the tunnels go in a straight line, and it is true that
their direction is consistent, but the angles of the walls, floor,
and ceiling constantly change, and the passages themselves
may narrow as little as two feet across, or be as much as 15
feet wide by 15 feet high. More strikingly, the ways
constantly rise and fall; it is impossible to see very far ahead
or very far behind. Even the glow of torches will not carry
far. These tunnels have an organic feel, and leave the
perception that some great alien beast had been imprisoned
within the stone, had then gotten free, and the fighters now
creep along the spaces left by its bones and sinews.

##### Rules

This is not a separate scenario but more of a set of rules to be
used by the moderator when he wants to situate a scenario in
the catacombs deep below Mordheim. The moderator could
read aloud the above section describing the tunnels the
warbands walk in to give the players a general impression of
their surroundings. Its up to the individual moderator how he
likes to represent these ancient catacombs on his table. It is
advised to use separate tiles or board sections to represent the
more narrow parts of the tunnels. Most fighting between the
warbands will probably be fought out in the larger and wider
parts of the catacombs. Both players should place their
warbands in a marching order, no more then two models
wide. This marching order represents the warbands exploring
the narrow tunnels.
Fighters exploring the catacombs must make a Fear Test
every other turn. If failed then that fighter won't walk any
further until he succeeds again on his Fear test. He may test
every turn to see if he will walk further down these ancient
tunnels.
Because the lines of sight will vary, if the warband include
toters of ranged magickal or physical attacks, moderators
should continue to monitor the march order of the warband to
ascertain if those weapons or spells can be brought to bear.

##### Encounters beneath the City

```
Not all of these encounters have an immediate effect on a
scenario. Some of the encounters are just to try to scare the
players and to give them a feeling for the atmosphere below
the city. The moderator should roll once in each of the
players Movement phases, before that player has moved.
3D6 EVENT
3 No encounter; warband proceed without incident.
4 A random fighter stumbles and falls; slimy luminous moss
coats his hands, elbows, and knees, which he is unable to
rub off. Because the fighter is now illuminated all hits
against him are at +1.
5 One of the fighters hear snatches of conversation; two men
are saying that intruders may be in the tunnels. The voices
cannot be located.
6 Random fighter slips and falls. That fighter suffers a S3
hit.
7 Warm liquid drips steadily from the tunnel ceiling; the
stone beneath is slick and red; the blood has no source.
8 A foul stench engulfs the warband; each fighter must take
a Toughness test on 1D6 or the fighter is at -1S for D3
turns.
9 Some shapeless thing is glimsed; but it leaves neither trace
nor track of its passage.
10 Macabre chuckles, growls, or groans are heard in the
blackness; maybe a single sound, maybe a hideous
cacaphony of noise erupts without reason.
11 A violent blast of wind extinguishes all unshielded candles
and torches. The warband is now in complete and utter
darkness. A fighter may try to re-lite a torche once a turn
by rolling below his Initiative on 1D6.
12 A small rock falls from the ceiling and strikes a random
fighter; the fighter suffers a S4 hit on the head and if
wounded is automatically Stunned unless he wears a
helmet, in that case the fighter counts as being Knocked
Down.
13 The floor of the tunnel is seen to be bordered by jet-black
roses.
14 Cave-in rains rocks on the warband. Each fighter must
make a Initiative test or suffer D3 S4 hits.
15 Narrow, deep pit; leading fighter must make an Initiative
test to avoid the slippery edge. If the roll fails roll a 2D6 to
determine depth of pit. The fighter suffers D3 hits of
Strenght equal to the depth of the pit.
16 1D6+4 Tunnel dwellers appear. Roll one die; odd result
indicates Tunnel dwellers come from the rear, even result
indicates the Tunnel dwellers come from the front. See
below for Tunnel dwellers rules.
17 Random fighter must make a Fear test. If he fails he
perceives that, in every direction, the brick walls of the
tunnel are rhythmically moving in and out, like breathing
lungs. The fighter must flee 2D6" back in the direction he
came from.
18 The warband stumbles upon the lair of the Ancient One.
Luckily it is not paying attention to these puny creatures.
Because of the sanity-blasting image of this Elder Being
all of the members of the warband must make a Fear test
with a –2 modifier. If more then three members succeed,
the warband can get away with 3D6 Gold Crowns and one
random Magic Item.

#### Sewer Fighting

By Christian Ellegaard, Thanks to the guys on the Egroups Mailing List who have come up with ideas and suggestions for
Sewer Fighting rules
As every good big city in the Empire, Mordheim has its own
sewer that helps the city staying clean. Being a big, complex
system of corridors, water pipes and gutters to lead the water,
all the waste of the inner as well as the outer parts of the city
are lead through these channels to the mighty river Stir, that
flows through Mordheim. Once in a while it happens that the
ground collapses above a sewer tunnel and creates an
entrance to the lower parts of the ruins, and many a warband
has explored these dungeons.
In addition, some of the most cold-blooded and fearless
warriors tend to establish their lair in the sub-urban terrain,
enjoying the humid, ill-smelling climate and the many
different mutated beasts that provide their food when
everything else fails. Sometimes it even happens that two
warbands clash with each other underground, and often they
will get into fight believing that the enemy is in possession of
Wyrdstone, gold, treasures or whatever. Sewer fighting is
quite different from fighting under the stars. Warriors tend to
panic much easier - even the slightest dripping of water or a
harmless bat crossing the corridor may scare a warrior, and
knowing that the enemy is nearby does not make things any
better.
Therefore, when fighting underground, use the following
rules:

##### Sewers

The sewer corridors can be represented by the standard
Warhammer Quest floorplans, but since these may be a bit
small for Warhammer Skirmish games it may be necessary to
make your own terrain or use any appropriate items for
creating a sewer-like scenery.
Later in this article I shall come up with a suggestion of how
you easily and quickly can make your own sewer terrain.

##### Darkness

Despite all warriors usually bring torches with them in the
sewers and even a few Heroes might have some lanterns, the
sewers are still darker than the night. Therefore, warriors in
the sewers have a limited range of vision which makes
shooting much harder.
Before the game, each warrior in each warband must be given
a special sewer Line of Sight. Roll a D6 for the warrior and
add an additional D6 for each full 2 Initiative the warrior has.
The result is the number of inches that the warrior can see!
Skaven, Dwarves, Vampires, Ghouls and the Possessed, who
are all used to the dark conditions, may roll 2D6 + D6 for
each full 2 Initiative points they have rather than only D6. In
addition, Skaven may automatically re-roll any results they
do not find satisfying, but they must accept the latter result
regardless if it is worse.
Dogs, feeling the terror that lurks in the sewers, will never
enter the sewers. Warbands with any kind of dogs must
therefore leave their pets outside!
To make things easier, however, henchman groups are
allocated a single Line of Sight instead of an individual
number for each warrior. Use the highest Initiative of the
group, representing the most agile and aware warrior warning

```
his comrades or pointing out special spots that they should try
to hit.
A warrior can shoot no longer than his maximum Line of
Sight, and neither can he run any longer since that would
mean he might run into some walls or other unexpected
obstacles. Use the standard Short and Long ranges when
shooting as described in the Mordheim rulebook.
You can use small cardboard counters or dice to remember
the Line of Sight of the different warriors.
```
##### Lanterns

```
Lanterns are very useful when fighting in sewers. Therefore,
when playing sewer scenarios lanterns are bought at 10 Gold
Crowns' cost rather than the standard cost, and only Heroes
may carry them. Use the standard rules for lanterns even in
the sewers.
However, lanterns do not only make it easier for the user to
see, but it also makes it much harder for the enemy to spot
him because he is getting blinded by the bright light of the
lantern. Any opponents that wish to shoot with missile
weapons against a warrior with a lantern may ignore his
standard Line of Sight because they are, after all, easier to
spot in the darkness, but they will always, regardless the
distance, hit on a D6 roll of 6.
A Hero or a Henchman group with a lantern may re-roll if
they fail the Leadership test to see if they may move, as
described below.
```
##### Psychology

```
As already mentioned, the dark, smelly, plague-infested and
horrible sewers of Mordheim can really scare a mortal man or
beast to death, especially in a cut-throat fight against a deadly
opponent.
Therefore, all warbands, except Skaven who actually live
there and the Undead that really has no fear, are subject to the
following rules:
Before each turn, each Henchman group must take a
Leadership test based on their standard Leadership value
without penalties. If they fail, then something has scared
them - probably nothing else than their own shadow on the
walls or a silly little rat scuttling over the muddy and dirty
floor. The Henchmen may do nothing this turn, and if they
are in close combat then they are only allowed to defend and
parry any opposing attacks.
If they succeed the test, then they may move as normal.
If the group has a Hero with them, then they may re-roll one
of the failed dice representing the Hero talking encouraging
to them.
All warriors in a warband get a -1 Leadership penalty for
fighting in scary surroundings. Warriors are more likely to
turn around and flee than in daylight, and at any ordinary
Psychology tests they use their standard Leadership value -1.
Note, however, that this does not apply when rolling for
Leadership before a Henchman may move.
```

##### Dirty slimy floor

Many of the major tunnels in a sewer are used for leading the
worst dirt, faces and waste away from the city while other
rooms are simply used for containing waste. Often it can be
difficult to see if it is possible to trespass the floor, and
therefore it sometimes appears that warriors jump into deep
holes that are filled with old refuse.
Generally there are 4 different kinds of floors:
Muddy but clear: Old waste is laying here and there,
although not in thick layers. The floor is rather clear, and it is
possible to enter the floor and move as normal.
Water: The floor is lowered so that it can lead water through
the sewer, and the water reaches a normal man to his waist.
That means that the warrior can choose to swim rather than
walk through the water! In the beginning of any turn a
warrior in water may swim. A warrior may swim no more
than his total Movement rate. When a warrior is swimming it
is impossible to hit him with any missile weapon. It is
impossible to run through water despite warriors may walk
normally.
Deep sludge: The floor is covered by a thick layer of sludge
and waste, and it makes it harder to move through. A warrior
crossing a sludgy floor gets a -1 Movement penalty and
becomes unable to run. In addition, enemies shooting at a
warrior wading through deep sludge will suffer a -1 To Hit
penalty because the sewage might take some of the shots that
are directed against the warrior. If the warrior is engaged in
Close Combat he will suffer a -1 To Hit penalty too because
fighting in deep dirt is indeed harder than fighting on normal
ground.
Messy slippery floor: The floor is very slippery, and the
warriors tend to trip over especially when running across the
section. Each time a warrior walks over or moves from a
merry slippery floor, roll a D6: On a result of 1 the warrior
trips over and is knocked down. If the warrior is running,
then he will fall over on a D6 roll of 1-3!
You can either decide before the battle which type of floor
the different sewer sections contain which is especially
appropriate when fighting over your own, modeled terrain
where you can represent the sludge, water or whatever on the
floorplans, or you can decide it randomly while the battle is
on. If you choose the latter option, roll 2D6 every time a
warrior enters a new sewer section:
Random floor table
2D6 Result
2-5 Deep sludge
6-8 Muddy but clear
9-10 Water
11-12 Messy slippery floor

##### Rotten planks

```
In many a sewer channel, wooden sidewalks have been built
so that the sewer workers could easier pass through the
tunnels. However, the bad climate in the sewers have meant
that the wooden planks have rot, and here and there they are
broken too.
A warrior who wishes to run over a wooden bridge, sidewalk
etc. or jump down on it must first pass an Initiative test,
subtracting 1 from the die (natural 6's always fail). If the
warrior fails he has crashed through the bridge and will fall
down as described below.
Place a special Crashed Planks counter (no, you can't find it
in the boxed set - you got to make your own!) on the spot
where the warrior's movement ended. Other warriors that
might wish to cross a Crashed Planks counter must jump!
Skaven, being very used to the tunnels, know exactly where
to place their paws on the walkways without falling through.
Therefore, Skaven automatically pass this Initiative test and
may run freely over wooden walkways and bridges.
```
##### Face down in the sludge

```
Sometimes it happens that warriors fall down in the sewage
or become knocked down in a close combat. This is very
uncomfortable indeed!
A warrior falling into the sewage from a higher point will get
plunged into the slimy muddy sludge, and this is hard to
escape! Measure the distance the warrior fell in inches, the
distance being the number of turns the warrior will be in the
sewage. However, no damage is done when hitting the
sewage unlike falling down on a normal ground.
If the warrior is wearing Heavy Armor then there is no
mercy: The heavy metal plates are dragging the warrior
down, and being unable to cut off the straps he will slowly
suffocate... Tip: Do not run with warriors that are wearing
Heavy Armor!
In close combat it is also quite hard getting up again if being
knocked down. Therefore, when a warrior wishes to get up
after having being knocked down or stunned he must pass an
Initiative test on a D6. Otherwise he will remain knocked
down.

#### Fire

By Steve Hart with help from the guys at the Mordheim e-mail list
Mordheim even though now in ruins is still plagued with
fires. Now left alone these fires can spread quickly through
the ruins. These fires have many causes and on occasions
warbands have been known to get caught in the midst of a
raging fire while fighting.

##### When and Where

These fire rules are not for any specific scenario. The use of
these rules is to add a bit more chaos to the battles that rage
across the city. They can be added to any game as long as
both players agree.

##### Starting

Before the game starts but after the terrain has been set up
randomly choose one building to be on fire. Mark this
building with a counter or plumes of smoke or any other way
that you can think of.
NOTE: If you are playing a scenario that focuses on a
specific building (like defend the find) then the objective
building cannot start the game on fire.

##### It spreads!

As the buildings burn, their flames can jump to other building
quickly setting them ablaze. At the end of each players turn
roll a dice for each building that is on fire and consult the
chart below:
1 GOES OUT: The fire has exhausted all the flammable
materials in the building and goes out as quickly as it
appeared.
2 - 3 KEEPS BURNING: The flames continue the ravage the
building but do not spread this turn.
5 - 6 SPREADS: The fire spreads to the nearest (non-burning)
building within 10"
Roads cannot set on fire due to the lack of substantial burning
items. If however you have a road that is covered in
flammable object you can count this as the nearest building.

##### Entering buildings on fire

Entering a building that is surrounded in flame is a risky
option but some will dare to venture into the flames.
You must declare that a model is entering a building on fire
before he/she does so. The model must now make a
leadership test to overcome the fear of entering the building.
If they pass this test they may enter the building. If the model
fails then that model will not enter the building and cannot
move for the rest of the turn.

##### Moving inside

Models inside the building have to constantly dodge flames
and falling timber (like in the action films), and one mistake
can stop even a hero in his tracks.

```
Models wishing to move while inside an ablaze building
must pass an initiative test to do so, otherwise they cannot
move (blocked by falling timber, flames etc.).
```
##### Climbing

```
Models may never climb the wall of building that are
burning.
```
##### Damage

```
Funnily enough running around inside a building that is
currently on fire is not good for ones health! At the end of
each turn all models inside buildings that are ablaze must roll
under their toughness on a D6.
If a models rolls equal to his toughness then the smoke from
the flames fill their lungs and prevents them from breathing
for a turn. The model instantly becomes stunned.
If the roll is over the models toughness statistic then the
model instantly suffers D3 strength 3 hits that ignore all
armour saves except magical ones.
```
##### Frenzy

```
The more unhinged inhabitants of Mordheim are less likely to
care for the fact that the building they are entering is on fire
(or they just don’t notice)
Models that are subject to the frenzy rules are unaffected by
the rules for entering and moving around inside buildings that
are burning (they just don't care), but they still have to make
a test on their toughness at the end of their turn.
```
##### Starting Fires

```
Models cannot start fire unless stated in their rules or by
equipment that they are carrying.
```
##### Shooting

```
The roaring flames block most site into the buildings and the
heat distorts the air around it causing it impossible to aim.
You cannot shoot out of or into a building that is on fire.
Neither may you shot through a building on fire.
```
##### Combat

```
Sometimes the fire will spread to buildings where opponents
are fighting in hand to hand combat. Event though very
dramatic the fighters are put into an even more reason to win
(and then run).
Hand to hand combat within a burning building is unaffected
except that the models must roll at the end of their turn to see
if they take damage from the flames.
To charge another model while you are inside a burning
building you must pass an initiative test. If this test is failed
the model may do nothing in that movement phase. To charge
from outside you must make a leadership test. Failing this
test will also result in being able to do nothing in that
movement phase.

#### Random Happenings

Mordheim is a dark and sinister city – dangers lurk around every corner. Even the basic laws of nature cannot be relied upon.
Mark Havener and Tim Huckelbery explain how these dangers can be introduced to your battles.
These rules represent the weird and wonderful things that can
happen in Mordheim which are beyond the control of players.
These rules are intended to be optional and should only be
used if agreed on by all players taking part. To determine if a
random encounter occurs, roll a D6 at the start of each
player’s turn. A result of 1 indicates a random encounter.
Roll a D66 for the random encounter on the chart opposite to
see what exactly is encountered and follow the directions.
The player whose turn it is places any models that represent
the encounter and they will act in each of his turns (that
player doesn’t control their actions though, see the individual
descriptions to see how the models act). This player is known
as the ‘Encountering Player’, even though random encounters
will frequently affect only his opponent or both players
indiscriminately. The models that represent a random
encounter must all be placed within 6" of a randomly
determined board edge and they will remain within 2" of
another member of their group at all times. Random

```
encounter members must be placed (and will remain, unless
their description indicates otherwise) at ground level in the
open. The Encountering Player places the models
representing the random encounter, but note that they cannot
initially be placed within 12" of any warband models.
After being placed, many encounters will travel as quickly as
possible (without running) towards the nearest warband
model. For this purpose the nearest model is the model that
the encounter can reach most quickly and encounter models
will never climb the sides of a building to get at a warband
member. What each encounter does from there is listed in its
description. Note that charging models will engage as many
warband members as they can reach, ganging up if some of
them can’t reach different models. No more than one random
encounter will ever take place in a single game, so after a
random encounter is rolled, the players no longer need to roll
at the start of their turns. Several of the entries below refer to
game turns, this includes both players’ turns.
```
###### Random Encounters Chart

Roll D66
11 Ogre Mercenary
An Ogre Mercenary (see the Hired Swords section of the Mordheim
rules for details on the Ogre Mercenary) appears further down the
street. Sensing trouble brewing, he decides to seize the opportunity
and offer his services to the warband with the lowest warband rating
(if there are two warbands with the same rating, roll a dice to see
whom he offers his help to). The warband that he offers to help must
add the Hired Sword to its roster for this game. At the end of the
game, the Ogre demands payment for services rendered. The
warband that he joined must pay his hire and upkeep fee. If the
warband cannot (or will not) pay him, he leaves, but not before
taking out his frustration on a random member of the warband (only
roll among members of the warband who were not taken out of
action during the game). Roll for injuries to this unfortunate
member just as if he had been taken out of action.
12 Swarm of Rats
Something in the sewers has frightened the rats that live there. The
rats are in a hurry to get away and will attack anything that stands in
their way. Use a template 80mm x 120mm to represent the rats. Six
monster bases (use rat swarms if you have them), placed in a
rectangle with one short side representing the front, will do nicely.
The rats move 2D6" each turn. They will always move forward
down the centre of the street and if they come to an intersection roll
randomly to determine which direction they take (example: for a
normal four-way cross-intersection roll a D6: 1-2 right, 3-4 straight
forward, 5-6 left). The rats cannot be engaged in close combat and if
they make contact with a model they will run right over him. Any
model moved over by the rats will suffer D3 Strength 2 hits, normal
armour saves apply.
13 Earthquake
Powerful magical energies from the crater at the centre of the city
shake the local landscape. The ground heaves and buckles violently
and warband members find it hard to keep their footing. Roll a D3 to
determine how many game turns the earthquake lasts. While the
shaking persists, all movement is halved, all Initiative tests
(climbing, etc) suffer a -2 penalty and all Shooting and Close
Combat to hit rolls are made with a -1 penalty.
14 High Winds

```
A powerful wind screams through the area, wildly scattering debris
and knocking down anything that is not firmly anchored to the
ground. Warband members now suffer a -1 penalty to all Initiative
tests (climbing, jumping, etc) and to hit rolls (close combat and
shooting) for the rest of the game.
15 Blood for the Blood God!
Unfortunately for the warbands involved, the scent of blood has
brought the attention of one of Khorne’s minions. Reality is
breached as a vicious Bloodletter emerges from the Realm of Chaos
to shed even more blood for its master. The Bloodletter has the
following characteristics in the Beast, Monsters & townsfolk section
Special Rule: The Bloodletter will stay for D6 turns after which it
will disappear.
16 Lucky Find
One random model, on his feet and not in hand-to-hand combat or
fleeing, has stumbled upon a shard of wyrdstone! Assuming he
doesn’t go out of action, this is added to any other shards the
warband finds after the game. If he is taken out of action in close
combat, the enemy model steals the shard away! Note that only non-
animal models can find or steal a shard, not Dire Wolves, Hunting
Dogs, etc.
21 Restless Spirit
Countless unfortunates have suffered agonising deaths in countless
forms since the comet crashed into the city. Not all of these
individuals can easily accept their new condition and they refuse to
rest. Perhaps they left some important task unfinished or seek
revenge on those who did them harm. The warbands have stumbled
upon one such ghost. Any warband member who is within 8" of the
spirit at the start of its Movement phase must make a Leadership test
or flee (exactly as if he were fleeing from combat). Models that are
immune to psychology automatically pass this test. This creature is
unable to affect (or be affected by) the physical world, but it is very
frightening nonetheless. The spirit moves 4" in a random direction,
moving through walls, obstacles or warband members as if they
were not there. It will not charge and cannot be harmed by the
warband members in any way. The only exception to this is if the
spirit comes into contact with a Sigmarite Matriarch or a Warrior-
Priest of Sigmar. These models may choose to put the dead to rest.
If the player controlling such a model decides to do this, the spirit is
```

immediately banished (disappears and does not return) and the priest
gains one Experience point.

```
22 Burning Building
Suddenly, one of the buildings (chosen at random) bursts into
flames, ignited by smouldering embers from a fire thought
extinguished long ago. Any models inside take a S3 hit unless they
move outside in that turn and any models within 2" of the walls take
a S2 hit from the smoke and heat unless they move further away as
well. For the rest of the game, the building itself will cause fear due
to the intense flames and anyone who wishes to enter it must first
pass a Fear test exactly as if they wished to charge a fear-causing
enemy.
23 Man-Eater
One of the trees growing in the area has been changed into a
carnivorous predator by exposure to the Chaos magic inundating the
area. Randomly determine which member of the Encountering
Player’s warband finds the plant. That model is attacked as a large
mouth opens up in the trunk of the tree and its branches whip down
to grab its unfortunate victim. Place a tree next to the victim. He is
now considered to be in close combat with the tree, which has the
following characteristics:
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Tree 0 3 0 4 6 3 3 2 10
The tree automatically passes any Leadership tests it is required to
make. Any result on the Injury table will cause the Man-Eater to
stop attacking, though it is not possible to actually take it out of
action or knock it down. Opponents are +1 to hit the tree, due to the
fact that it is rooted to the spot!
24 Skeletons
While the intense magic of the area rapidly dissolves skeletons to
dust, shambling hordes of them spring up at random from the bones
of the fallen. Uncontrolled, they roam the city wasteland, blindly
attacking everything they find before falling apart.
Use the Profile of the Skeleton in Beasts Monsters & Townsfolk
Section. 2D6 Skeletons appear.
with the following profile:
They are armed with simple weapons or bony fists (treat as daggers
in close combat). The skeletons will move towards and attack the
closest models as quickly as possible. Roll a D3 when they appear,
after that many turns they crumble back to inanimate bones (count
the current turn as the first one).
25 The Twisting of the Air
Reality itself seems to twist, warping perceptions until no one can be
sure of what their senses tell them. Roll a D6 at the start of each
player’s turn. For the next D3 game turns, the distance within which
warriors can use their Leader’s Leadership value and the distance
for being All Alone is the value rolled instead of the normal 6". All
distances between models are also increased by the same D6" roll
for purposes of weapon ranges and charging. Note that the actual
models are not moved, but only the shooting/charging model’s
perception of the distance.
```

26 Spawn
The warbands have stumbled upon one of the many former
inhabitants of the city that got too close to the crater at the centre of
the city and was turned into a mindless spawn. Spawn have the
following characteristics:
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Spawn 2D6 3 0 4 4 2 3 2D6 10
Fear: Spawn are disgusting and revolting blasphemies against
nature and cause fear.
Psychology: They are mindless creatures, knowing no fear of pain
or death. Spawn automatically pass any Leadership based test they
are required to make.
Movement: The Spawn moves 2D6" towards the nearest model in
each of its Movement phases. It does not double its movement for
charging, instead if its movement takes it into contact with a model
it counts as charging and engages that model in close combat.
Attacks: Roll at the beginning of each Close Combat phase to
determine the spawn’s number of Attacks for that phase.
31 Collapsing Building
Pick one building at random. Any models inside must pass an
Initiative test or suffer a S5 hit, armour saves applying as normal, as
the building collapses. Remove the building from the table
(replacing with ruins if possible), and place the models back on the
table where it stood. Any models climbing the sides of a building or
on the roof when it collapses automatically fall from whatever
height they were at.
32 Scrawling on a Wall
A randomly determined warband member who is within 4" of a
building (if there are no models this close to a building, ignore this
encounter), sees writing suddenly appear in blood on the wall
closest to him. Roll on the following table to find out what the
writing says:
D6 Result
1 The writings are a map of the area. The model’s warband
receives a +1 on the roll to pick the scenario for the next
game they take part in.
2 Reading the writing accidentally sets off a spell on the
reader. The model suffers a minor curse and now has a -1
penalty to all dice rolls for the rest of the game.
3 The warband member learns of the remains of some booty
inside the building. If he moves inside he finds a D6 gold
crowns.
4 The writings reveal all the hiding places in the area. The
model can hide, even in the open, for rest of the game.
5 The warband member learns of a secret passage inside the
building – if he moves inside, he can pop out next turn in
any other building.
6 A fun read, but nothing else happens (Veskit was here!).
33 Thick Fog
A fog rolls in, thick as pea soup. Models can only see 2D6" (roll
once for the distance all models can see; do not roll individually for
each model). Re-roll at start of each Encountering Player’s turn to
see what the visibility is for that turn. The fog lasts for the rest of the
game.
34 Hands of Stone
Hands of earth and stone suddenly jut out of the ground in a small
area of the battlefield. The Encountering Player must pick a spot
anywhere on the battlefield and anything within 3" of that spot is
affected. The area is now very difficult ground as the hands grasp
and attempt to hold anyone passing near them. This encounter lasts
one game turn, at the end of which the hands sink back into the
ground.

```
35 Dog Pack
Recent events in Mordheim have caused many of the city’s dogs to
suddenly find themselves without homes. Groups of these animals
have turned feral and formed into hunting packs. The warbands have
been discovered by one such (very hungry) pack. The pack consists
of 2D3 wild dogs (use the Hunting Dog stats from the Witch Hunter
warband list). The dogs move as quickly as they can toward the
nearest models, dividing themselves as evenly as they can between
multiple targets if they are available. If members of a dog pack take
a warband member out of action, he will be eaten if not rescued. If
no friendly model comes within 6" of where the model fell by the
end of that warband’s next turn, the fallen member is considered lost
(dog food). If a dog pack fails a Rout test, they leave without taking
their ‘food’ with them, any warband members taken out of action in
the last turn of the game have not been eaten and follow the normal
rules for models taken out of action.
36 Possessed!
One randomly selected member of the Encountering Player’s
warband is suddenly possessed by a minor spirit. This spirit is far
too weak to control the model’s entire body, but is instead limited to
controlling one of his or her limbs (usually an arm). The model
takes an automatic hit at his or her own Strength during each of his
or her Close Combat phases until the possession is over and may do
nothing else. The possession lasts D3 game turns. Note that
Sigmarite Matriarchs and Warrior-Priests are immune to this
possession, as are non-living warband members. If such a warband
member is the object of the spirit’s attention, randomly determine
another warband member to suffer the effect instead.
41 Fountain of Blood
The city itself seems to weep as even more blood is shed on its
streets. For the rest of the game, whenever a model is taken out of
action in close combat, the model that did the deed must take a
Strength test or be knocked down as he is hit by a torrent of blood
pouring from the ground. If there were others involved in the
combat they are not affected, as the steaming liquid seems to be
directed only at those who have called it into being by their
bloodthirsty actions.
42-44 Storm of Chaos
Clouds rapidly gather above the city in an unnatural, sickly yellow-
green mass and warp lightning begins to dance from one cloud to
another. Thunder rocks the air, screaming out in almost intelligible
noises. The clouds themselves seem to take on the shapes of
monstrous creatures and both warbands in the conflict look at each
other with fear on their faces. Roll a D6 to see what the storm
manifestation will bring:
```
Assembled By Paul H Page 307 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


D6 Result
1 Warp lightning begins to strike the ground in search of a
victim. It will hit the warrior with the best armour save,
attracted to the large amount of metal. That warrior takes a
S5 hit, with no armour save possible. If multiple warriors all
have the highest armour save, randomly determine which is
struck. The warp lightning will strike for D3 turns before
moving on towards another part of the city.
2 Fish suddenly fall out of the sky to pelt the area! All
movement is halved for one turn (due to wet, flapping fish
underfoot), but there is no other effect.
3 Wyrdstone dust has mixed with the water vapour in the area
and produced the strange looking clouds from which a
tainted rain begins to fall. The rain burns flesh and eats into
stone and metal. Each warband member in the open takes a
single S2 hit (normal armour saves apply) every turn the rain
lasts until he gets under cover. The rain lasts D3 turns.
4 A magical mass of lightning forms near the ground,
illuminating the area with an eerie greenish glow. It begins
to move about the area, drawn to magical powers from
which it feeds. Place a counter as per the normal Encounter
rules to represent the mass and each turn move it 2D6"
towards the highest level spell user (the one with the most
spells – each turn roll a D6 if two or more spell users have
the highest number of spells). If there are no magic users in
the game, the mass will move towards the opposite table
edge, doing nothing but blocking line of sight as it moves. If
the model the mass is moving towards casts a spell,
immediately move the counter another D6" towards the
model. If the ball of lightning touches the target model, the
model is frozen in time and cannot do anything. While
frozen, the model cannot be attacked or harmed in any way

- the lightning mass protects its prey! After freezing a
model, the lightning will no longer move but will instead
remain near its victim to feed. The lightning will feed for D3
turns on the magical energy of its victim and then flies back
towards the warp clouds above, freeing the magic user. If
the game ends before the feeding is done, the victim is
immediately released. Victims suffer no long-term ill effects
from their exposure to the lightning.
5 A rumbling is heard from overhead, as thunder erupts from
the strange clouds. The thunderclaps become more intense
and the heavy pulses of air brings warriors to their knees as
if they had been hit by cannonballs of solid air. D6 randomly
selected models are knocked down by the air bursts. If any of
these models are in close combat, all other members of that
melee are knocked down as well.
6 Tendrils of smoke drift down from the clouds, winding
around the heads of members of each warband. Randomly
select one Hero from each warband – these warriors have
been chosen by rival storm gods as their champions. The
chosen models must move towards each other every turn
and get into close combat as quickly as possible. Once in
combat, they will automatically pass all Leadership tests and
will fight until only one remains (the combat will end when
one of the models puts his rival out of action). If a warband
does not have any Heroes left in play when the storm gods
choose their champions, a random Henchman will be chosen
from that warband instead.
45 Pit Fighter
This encounter is identical to the Ogre Mercenary encounter before,
except the Hired Sword encountered is a Pit Fighter, not an Ogre
Mercenary.

```
46 Plague of Flies
An enormous cloud of flies appears in the sky and swoops down on
the warbands below. All models have an extra -1 to hit penalty when
shooting or fighting in close combat as flies buzz around them and
into open orifices. The flies remain for D3 game turns and then fly
away.
51 Sinkhole
An enormous mouth suddenly opens up under the feet of one
randomly determined warband member. Make an Initiative test for
the model. If the test is failed, the model falls into the pit. If a 1 is
rolled for the test, the model is sucked underground and taken out of
action. Any other failure results in the model catching himself in the
opening, which closes around him. Treat the model as being
knocked down for the rest of the game, though he may not move at
all.
52 The Horror in the House
Randomly select one warrior lurking alone inside a building (if there
are no warband members inside a building, ignore this result and re-
roll on the Random Encounters table). Unfortunately for him, he’s
not as alone as he thought. He hears a slight ripping sound as if the
air itself is being torn apart and something manifests itself behind
him. The warrior must make a Fear test and if he fails, in his next
Movement phase he will run screaming 2D6" from the building
towards the nearest table edge and can do nothing else in that turn. If
he passes the test, the unnatural presence still forces him D6"
outside, but he suffers no other effects. At the start of his subsequent
turn, a fleeing model can try to recover from his ordeal by passing a
Leadership test, but at a -1 penalty. If he does, he stops, but cannot
do anything else that turn other than catch his breath. If he fails, he
again moves 2D6", trying in vain to erase the terrifying images from
his memory. For the rest of the game, the building itself will cause
fear, and anyone who wishes to enter it must first pass a Fear test
exactly as if they wished to charge a fear-causing enemy.
53 Plague Victims
Disease is a common occurrence among the few survivors left in the
ruins of the city. This group of a D6 citizens has contracted a
particularly nasty plague known as Nurgle’s Rot. They move at
normal rate (4") towards the nearest warband members, seeking
their help. If they come into contact with a warband member, they
will not attack, but will instead cling to him as they beseech his aid,
hindering him greatly. A model with Plague Victims in contact with
him acts as if he had just recovered from being knocked down
(moves at half rate, may not charge or run, etc. See the Mordheim
rules for details). If one or more of the Plague Victims is charged,
shot at, or otherwise attacked, these pitiful victims will rout
immediately. At the end of the game, roll a dice for each warband
member in play when the Plague Victims appeared and on a roll of
1, that member has contracted Nurgle’s Rot. Roll again to see what
effect the disease has on that member:
D6 Result
1 Major Symptoms: The plague races through the victim’s
system, producing horrible disfiguring lesions before killing
him. If the model is a Henchman, he dies. If the model is a
Hero, roll D3 times on the Serious Injury table (ignoring
Robbed, Bitter Enmity, Captured and Sold to the Pits
results) to determine the long term effects of the disease.
2-5 Minor Symptoms: The plague takes its toll on the victim as
it takes its course. Without proper bed rest the victim will
die. The warband member must miss the next game as he
recovers.
6 Full Recovery! The victim has an especially hardy
constitution or gets an extremely mild case of the disease.
The victim suffers no ill effects.

54 Last One Standing
The horrors of Mordheim can drive even the strongest mind past the
point of madness. This Sigmarite Matriarch (for stats see the Sisters
of Sigmar section of the Mordheim rules) has seen her entire
warband cut down around her and the experience has proven too
much for. She now seeks revenge and is not particular about who
gets to pay! She is armed with a Sigmarite Hammer and steel whip
and wears heavy armour and a helm. She carries Blessed Water and
a Holy Relic on her person as well. She knows the prayers The
Hammer of Sigmar and Armour of Righteousness (see the Prayers of
Sigmar chart in the Mordheim rules for details). Roll randomly to
determine which she casts on herself each turn. She has the skills
Absolute Faith, Jump Up and Step Aside. The Matriarch will move
as quickly as possible towards the nearest model and engage them in
close combat if able. She will not rout and must be taken out of
action to make her stop. If the Matriarch is taken out of action, leave
her body where it fell, any non-animal warband member may loot
her body by moving into contact with it during their Movement
phase. If this warrior is later taken out of action as well, place a
counter where the warrior fell to represent the Matriarch’s
equipment. This can then be picked up by a different model, as
above.
55 Booby Traps
Some nefarious individuals have trapped the whole area the
warbands are searching. These traps may take the form of spiked
pits, deadfalls, spring-driven spiked boards, etc. When this
encounter is rolled, the Encountering Player must randomly
determine which of his warband members has discovered the first
trap. This unfortunate individual springs a trap immediately. If the
trap is not avoided by passing an Initiative test, the model takes a
Strength 3 hit; armour saves apply as normal. From this point until
the end of the game, each player will roll a D6 at the start of his or
her Movement phase. A roll of 1 means that one member of that
player’s warband has sprung a trap and must make an Initiative test
to avoid it. If the trap is not avoided, the model takes a S3 hit as
above; apply any damage before the model is moved.
56 Catacombs
The ground gives way under one randomly selected warrior and he
falls into the depths of the catacombs below the city. He takes a S3
hit from the fall unless he passes an Initiative test, and lands near the
remains of others who have fallen before him. Assuming he’s not
taken out of action by the fall, he discovers one of the following
after a quick search (roll a D6):
D6 Result
1 A helmet
2 A small pouch containing 2D6 gold crowns
3 A lantern
4 A net
5 A vial of Black Lotus
6 A sword
Unless he has a rope & hook, the warrior is stuck in the catacombs
and cannot rejoin the game. He will count as being out of action for
Rout purposes, but will rejoin his warband after the game with no
other untoward effects. If he does have a rope & hook, he can climb
out D3 turns later, appearing inside a randomly determined building.

```
61 Forbidden Fruit
Ghostly white flowers suddenly open on a tree in the area and emit a
powerful fragrance. Randomly determine a member of the
Encountering Player’s warband who happens to be standing next to
the tree when it comes to life. Place the tree within 2" of this model.
Any warband members within 8" of the tree must make a
Leadership test at the start of each of their turns or move as quickly
as possible towards the tree. If within 1" of the tree, a spellbound
model will pick and eat one of the swollen, blood-red fruit hanging
from its branches. Any model eating one of the fruit is automatically
taken out of action, as powerful poisons incapacitate him or her. A
non-spellbound warband model may keep another model from
moving toward the tree by moving into base to base contact with
him or her and holding him back. Neither model may do anything
else while the spellbound model attempts to move to the tree and the
restraining model attempts to prevent him from doing so. Both
spellbound and restraining models can react normally if attacked in
close combat and a restraining model can give up his attempts at any
time. This encounter lasts the remainder of the game. Close
inspection of the tree reveals the bones of several animals
overgrown with grass and leaves lying at its base.
62 The Lost
Many view the destruction of Mordheim as a sign that the world is
coming to an end. Groups of these lunatics are often drawn to the
city where they attack anyone they come across, certain that they are
in some way helping to avert this cataclysm. This group of D3
Flagellants (see the Witch Hunter section of the Mordheim rules for
stats and special rules) will move as quickly as possible towards the
nearest warband members and engage them in close combat as soon
as they are able. They are armed with flails.
63 Reflecting Pool
One warrior on the ground (selected at random from the
Encountering Player’s warband) notices a small pool of what looks
to be still water. Reflecting the gloomy sky above, it appears to be
liquid metal or unnaturally deep silvery water, rippling only slightly
with the dank breeze blowing through the city. He can ignore it, or
bend quickly to peer into its depths. If he’s brave enough to gaze
into the murky liquid, roll a D6:
D6 Result
1 The water reflects back nightmare images of his own
demise, filling him with fear for his own safety. For the rest
of the game, no matter how far away he is from friendly
models, he will always count as being all alone in close
combat.
2 The warrior glimpses an image of what is yet to come. For
the rest of the current turn he may re-roll (once!) any
shooting or close combat rolls to hit.
3 A faint image of his personal god appears, be it Sigmar or
even the dread Shadowlord. Filled with courage, the warrior
may ignore any and all Leadership-based tests he is required
to make for the rest of the game.
4 The warrior peers into the depths of his own mind,
unlocking untapped abilities. He can detect any enemy
models hidden that turn, even those not in his normal line of
sight, and passes the information on to the rest of his
compatriots. All enemy models lose their hidden status.
5 A slender arm reaches out from the pool, leaving no ripples
in the smooth liquid, and pale fingers touch the warrior’s
chest. The soft caress causes a faint glow, which spreads
throughout his body. Though it quickly dims away, a strong
feeling of strength and vitality is left behind. The warrior
may ignore the next wounding hit he receives, even if it is a
critical hit.

6 The city chooses to reveal its true visage to the warrior,
unveiling the monstrous intelligence that lurks behind the
facade of simple ruins and rubble. The warrior’s mind is
overwhelmed by the enormity of the impression and he
stumbles away in stark terror. For the rest of the game, all
enemy models count as causing fear to the warrior and he
will refuse to enter any buildings or get within 2" of any
walls or ruins. After the game the effects will wear off,
though he will always hesitate slightly before entering an
unlit room from now on...
Note: Only warriors who can gain in experience can choose to look
into the pool, all others simply lack the curiosity to bother!
64 Screaming Walls
Faces appear in the walls of one randomly determined building and
start to emit a piercing shriek. Any warband members within 8" of
the building take a S1 hit (no armour saves allowed) and are at -1 on
all to hit rolls (close combat and shooting) while the screaming lasts.
Spellcasters are even more sensitive to the noise than others and so
no spells may be cast from within this radius. Roll a D3 to determine
how many game turns the screaming lasts.
65 Peddler

```
No matter which turn it is rolled on, this encounter happens at the
end of the game. The winning warband sees a peddler wandering
through the ruins. This travelling merchant keeps his entire stock on
his back and offers to sell part of it to the warband. He has the
following items at half their normal price: mace, hammer, sword,
dagger, axe, helmet, crossbow, pistol, duelling pistol, rope & hook,
any poison, lucky charm, blessed water, hunting arrows, garlic,
healing herbs, holy (or unholy) relic, lantern and Mordheim map.
Roll a D3 for each item to find the quantity the peddler carries.
66 Itsy-Bitsy Spider
The presence of the wyrdstone has mutated this common household
pest into a monster of titanic proportions! This Gigantic Spider has
the following characteristics:
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Spider 5 3 0 5 4 4 1 2 10
Fearsome Beast: The Gigantic Spider causes fear.
Chitinous Hide: It has an armour save of 4+.
Poisonous Bite: Any to wound rolls of 5 or 6 (rather than just a 6)
are treated as critical hits.
The Gigantic Spider moves from the table edge it starts from to the
opposite table edge, attacking any warband members that get in its
path.

#### Power in the Stones

By Daniel Carlson
“Of course there’s magic in those stones... but it is dark magic, and only the desperate or the foolish would seek to
use it. Woe to us that our times are rich in both desperation and fools.” – Fabergus Reinhardt, Witch Hunter
The value of the wyrdstone shards is not simply the coin that
nobles and merchants are willing to pay for them. It is a well-
known fact that the stones are rich in magic, and they are said
to grant a variety of powers to those that learn to use them.
Tales are told among the common folk of stones that caused a
certain farmer’s harvest to double, or of the stone that made
old Herr Grutenbauer's dog speak like a man. True or not,
these tales hint at the powerful and chaotic forces at work in
the stones. The most common use for the stones’ magic has
to do with the discovery of the famed alchemist van Hoffman
of Reikland. It was he who first observed that Wyrdstone can
serve as a catalyst in the transmutation of base metals into
gold. This usage of the stones has come to be the primary
obsession of those who seek it, for many are willing to pay
princely sums for stones that will make them an even larger
fortune. Yet there are those who continue to seek the stones
for their more arcane uses, and even mercenaries have been
known to keep a stone or two that was thought to bring luck,
healing, or other magical benefits.
Yet the stones are ultimately the work of Chaos, and those
who seek to use them often learn to fear their magic rather
than harness it. For every tale of a harvest that doubled, there
are two about the harvests that rotted in the field when
exposed to the strange glow of the stones; and for every tale
of a dog that learned to speak like a man there are darker tales
of animals that turned into a gruesome parody of a man-beast.
The tales of magical healings are mixed with many of
mutation and death brought on by exposure to the stones. Yet
greed is the downfall of many in the City of the Damned, and
the greed for power is perhaps the greatest of all...
Note: Witch Hunters, Sisters of Sigmar, Bretonnians, High
Elf Shadow Warriors and Dwarfs are all too aware of the
corrupting power of the stones, and will not make use of
them under any circumstances.

##### Evaluating Stones

Instead of selling or storing all of a warband's wyrdstone
shards, a player may choose to have one or more of their
stones evaluated by an alchemist for useful magical
properties. This is done during the trading phase of the post-
battle sequence (consequently, this means if a stone is chosen
to be evaluated and yields no special power, it cannot
subsequently be sold until after the next battle). Instead of
searching for a rare item, a hero may take one shard of the
warband’s wyrdstone to an alchemist. Numerous alchemists
have flocked to Mordheim to study the stones, and they ply
their trade from tents and wagons in the encampments around
the city. Alchemists are known for their greed, however, and
they do not provide their services for free; for each stone
evaluated, the warband must pay 20 gold crowns. When the
stone is evaluated, roll 2D6 on the chart opposite:

```
2 Spell Stone. Any model who carries this stone into battle
may cast one randomly determined spell for the duration of
the battle, using the normal rules for spell casting. The spell
should be determined at random from the Lesser Magic spell
list, and a different spell should be generated before each
game in which the stone is used. This means the stone will
be more useful in certain battles than others, depending on
which spell it happens to provide for that game.
3 Stone of Regeneration. Any model who caries this stone
into battle will regenerate lost wounds at a rate of one
Wound regained each recovery phase. A model carrying this
stone treats all stunned results it suffers on the Injury Chart
as knocked down.
4 Stone of Might. A model who carries this stone into battle
will have one characteristic increased for the duration of the
battle. Roll a D6 to see which characteristic is affected
before each battle:
1 +1 Initiative 2 +1 Movement
3 +1 Strength 4 +l Toughness
5 +1 Attacks 6 +1 Wounds
Note that this temporary boost may take a characteristic
above normal racial maximums.
5 Stone of Warding. A model who carries this stone will not
be affected by hostile magic spells on a D6 roll of 4+.
6-8 No beneficial powers.
9 Stone of Luck. A model who carries this stone may re-roll
any dice roll he makes once per game. The second roll must
be taken. This power may not be combined with other 'luck
enhancements' like the spell Luck of Shemtek to yield re-
rolls on top of re-rolls, though it may be used to give a
model affected by these enhancements one additional re-roll
during the battle as normal.
10 Stone of Skill. A model who carries this stone into battle
will have one characteristic increased for the duration of the
battle. Roll a D6 to see which characteristic is affected
before each battle:
1-2+1 Weapon Skill 3-4+1 Ballistic Skill 5-6+1 Leadership
Note that this temporary boost may take a characteristic
above normal racial maximums.
11 Stone of Healing. A model who carries this stone may heal
one model within 2" of him (including himself) during each
recovery phase. The warrior regains one lost Wound. Note
that this healing is only beneficial to models who have more
than one Wound on their profile.
12 Stone of Protection. A model who carries this stone has
their armour save improved by one point (i.e. a 5+ save
becomes a 4+ save). Note that no model may ever have a
save better than 1+. If the model has no armour, the stone
gives him a 6+ armour save.
```

###### Using Stones

Stones may only be used by heroes, just like other equipment.
No hero may ever carry more than one stone at a time (the
combined Chaotic magic would instantly turn them into
Chaos Spawn). Using a wyrdstone’s power is always a
dangerous undertaking and to represent this, after every
battle, each hero who carried a stone must make a check to
see if they have been adversely affected by their usage of the
stone’s power. Make the check by rolling 2D6 for each hero:
a roll of 2, 3, 11 or 12 indicates that they have been affected.
Skaven, having a natural tolerance for warpstone, are only
affected on the roll of 2 or 12. Roll a D6 on the following
chart over the page to see what has happened to affected
models.
1 Spawn! The model has succumbed to the raw mutating
force of Chaos, and becomes a terrible Chaos Spawn. See
'Becoming a Chaos Spawn' below.
2 Weakened. The model has lost some of its life force to the
stone. One of the model's characteristics is permanently
reduced by one. Roll 2D6 to see which characteristic suffers:
1-2 Movement 3 Weapon Skill
4 Ballistic Skill 5-6 Strength
7-8 Toughness 9-10 Initiative
11-12 Leadership
If any characteristic is reduced to 0 as a result of the
weakening, the model becomes a Chaos Spawn. See
'Becoming a Chaos Spawn' below.
3-4 Sickened. Exposure to the stone's magic has made the
warrior physically ill. He must miss the next battle while he
recovers.
5-6 Mutation! The corrupting power of Chaos has caused the
model to gain a mutation. Roll on the Random Mutation
Table (see below).

###### Becoming a Chaos Spawn

Chaos Spawn are the wretched remains of one who has tasted
the power of Chaos and proved unable to withstand its
mutating touch. Wracked with waves of mutation and
change, a warrior is reduced to a monstrous beast of fangs,
tentacles, eyeballs, and other horrific growths. Their mind is
forever shattered, and they become a gibbering and mindless
servant of Chaos. Typically, when a being meets this fate, his
former comrades will put him out of his misery with a swift
death... unless that seems like too dangerous a task to
attempt, in which case they will simply herd the beast away
down one of Mordheim’s winding alleys or into the sewers.
There are, however, some who have a desire for and affinity
with Chaos Spawn that allows them to keep their mutated
friend among their ranks as a weapon and pet to use against
their enemies.
If one of your heroes becomes a Chaos Spawn he is
considered to be lost to the warband, unless your warband is
from the Cult of the Possessed or Skaven. Followers of
Chaos have a sort of semi-reverence for these mindless
beasts, and the Skaven have long been adept at training and
using the products of wyrdstone-induced mutation.
When the hero ‘Spawns’, any armour they were wearing is
lost in the storm of violent mutation that overtakes the
unfortunate warrior. Weapons and equipment are abandoned
by the creature, however, and may be reclaimed by the
warband. The new Spawn retains its previous characteristic
profile and any existing mutations, and immediately gains an
additional D6 mutations which should be generated on the

```
Random Mutation Table. If the hero was previously a spell
caster, all spell casting ability is lost. If the model became a
Spawn as the result of a characteristic being taken down to
zero, that characteristic becomes a 1 on the Spawn’s profile.
The Spawn's Movement characteristic may be deleted, as the
Spawn is now subject to a special rule that governs its
movement on the table top. The Spawn is now subject to the
following special rules:
Fear: The Spawn now causes fear.
Psychology: The Spawn is immune to all psychology rules.
Movement: Instead of normal movement, each movement
phase, the Spawn moves 2D6" towards any enemy model.
The Spawn must move straight towards an enemy, though
this need not be the nearest enemy, and may be an enemy the
Spawn cannot even see (Spawn have a plethora of senses,
magical and otherwise that tell them where their foes are). If
this movement brings the Spawn into contact with any model,
friend or foe, the Spawn immediately attacks it, and will
continue to fight in following rounds until the other model
has been taken out of action or fled. Spawn may move up
ladders and stairs, and may even attempt to climb walls
subject to the normal climbing rules.
The Spawn will not gain any experience points from future
battles; it is far too mindless to learn from its actions.
The Spawn should be represented by an appropriate model.
While this could be one of the Chaos Spawn models from the
Warhammer line, it's probably more satisfying and fun to
make your own. Spawn are the ultimate you-can-do-no-
wrong conversion project, where you can throw together all
sorts of stray bits to make a really unique model.
```
###### Random Mutation Table

```
Mordheim is a city under the sway of Chaos, and with Chaos
comes mutation and change. There are numerous ways by
which a warrior can be afflicted with mutation, and there are
some who actually seek out mutation as a 'reward’ of the
Chaos Powers. While mutations are not always harmful, and
indeed can often be helpful, they are a mark of Chaos, and as
such those who bear them are feared, shunned and persecuted
throughout the Empire.
The following is a table used to generate the colourful,
exotic, and sometimes debilitating mutations that will be
visited upon certain warriors at certain times (i.e. as a result
of exposure to Wyrdstone, for example). The table may also
prove useful to Game Masters who want to quickly generate
some interesting mutants for a special scenario. The table
uses a D66 roll, just like the Heroes Serious Injuries table in
the rulebook. If the mutant rolls a mutation that it already
possesses, re-roll it until a new mutation is generated.
Note: The great danger of mutation is that it will ultimately
overwhelm the victim with the corrupting power of Chaos,
reducing them to a monstrous and mindless Chaos Spawn. To
represent this danger, if a warrior ever has a characteristic
reduced to zero as the result of a mutation, they immediately
degenerate into a loathsome Chaos Spawn (see the full rules
for Chaos Spawn above).
Any member of a human, mercenary warband (this includes
both Ostlanders and Averlanders) that receives a mutation
marked with * is immediately drummed out of the warband
by his suspicious peers. Remove the hero from the roster, his
equipment is lost.
```

Random Mutation Table
Roll a D66
11 Acid Spray*: The mutant can spit acid at its foes. The acid spray
uses the mutant’s Ballistic Skill to hit, just as if the mutant were
firing a missile weapon. The spray has a range of 8", and a Strength
of 4. The mutant does not suffer any penalty for spraying a target at
long range, nor does the mutant suffer any penalty for moving and
spraying in the same turn.
12 Atrophy: A part of the mutant’s body has become shrivelled and
atrophied. Roll a D6:
1 Head - The mutant is now subject to stupidity.
2-4 Arm - The mutant loses the usage of one arm. The
mutant may only use a single one-handed weapon from
now on. If both arms are lost the mutant must be retired
from the warband unless it possesses a tail or bite attack
of some kind.
5-6 Leg - The mutant loses the usage of one leg. Divide the
mutant's Movement in half, rounding up. If both legs are
lost, the mutant must be retired from the warband.
13 Beaked*: The mutant has a beak like that of a bird or octopus,
though its other facial features remain unchanged. Unless the mutant
already possesses a bite attack, the mutant may make an additional
attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase due to its vicious bite.
14 Beweaponed Extremities*: The mutant’s hands are turned into
weapons! The mutant may no longer use other weapons or
equipment that would require the usage of hands.
On the plus side, it no longer has to worry about being caught
without a weapon! The mutant will gain the normal extra attack in
hand-to-hand for using an additional hand weapon, and the weapon
extremities follow the normal rules for weapons of their type (i.e.
sword extremities may be used to parry).
Roll a D6 for each arm to see what it becomes:
1-2 sword, 3-4 mace, 5-6 axe.
If the mutant grows two sword extremities, it may re-roll failed
parries just as if it had a sword and a buckler.
15 Blackblood: If the model loses a wound in close combat, anyone
in base contact with the model suffers a Strength 3 hit (no critical
hits) from the spurting corrosive blood.
16 Brightly Patterned Skin*: The mutant's skin becomes brightly
coloured with contrasting stripes, spots, or other patterns. No effect
on play, but a great excuse to paint an interesting new model!
21 Burning Body*: The mutant's body is constantly burning with
flickering tongues of hellish flame and burns with unnatural light.
The warrior may not carry any weapons or armour unless they are
magical, or forged from Gromril or Ithilmar. The mutant does not
suffer the usual penalties for fighting with his fists (no -1 to the
mutant's Strength, enemies do not add +l to armour saves). The
mutant always counts as having a lantern. Any model in base
contact with the mutant suffers an automatic Strength 2 hit at the
beginning of each close combat phase. The flames cannot cause
critical hits.
22 Cloud of Flies: The mutant is permanently surrounded by a great
swirling mass of flies. Opponents in close combat with the mutant
are at -1 on all to hit rolls, as the flies buzz into eyes, noses, and
mouths.
23 Cloven Hooves*: The warrior gains +l Movement.
24 Crystalline Body*: The mutant's body becomes living crystal,
which is tough, but easily shattered. The mutant's Toughness
becomes 6, while its Wounds become 1.
Neither of these attributes can subsequently be altered by experience
or mutation. If an experience advance indicates a change in one of
these characteristics, re-roll the advance until a different
characteristic advance is obtained.

```
25 Elastic Limbs*: The mutant's arms can stretch out, allowing the
mutant to attack from a distance. If the mutant is not in base contact
with an enemy model at the beginning of the hand-to-hand combat
phase, it may make one hand-to-hand attack against a single visible
enemy within 6" of the mutant. The enemy does not get a chance to
fight back.
26 Enormously Fat: The mutant becomes enormously fat and
bloated. Divide its Movement in half, rounding up; add +1 to its
Toughness; and reduce its Initiative by 1.
31 Extra Arm*: The mutant may use any single-handed weapon in
the extra arm, giving him +1 attack when fighting in hand-to-hand
combat. Alternatively, he may carry a shield or buckler in the extra
arm. If a mutant who is unable to use weaponry (i.e. Possessed,
Chaos Spawn, etc.) gains this mutation, they simply gain an extra
attack; they are still not permitted to use weapons.
32 Extremely Thin: The mutant becomes a matchstick figure,
sickly thin and bony. Divide its Toughness in half, rounding up.
33 Eyestalks*: The mutant has stalked eyes, similar to a crab. The
mutant now causes fear.
34 Fangs*: The mutant grows huge fangs, giving it an extra bite
attack (unless it already has one) in each hand-to-hand combat
phase. The bite attack uses the mutant's normal Strength.
35 Furry*: The mutant grows a covering of long, dense fur. The
mutation changes the mutant's appearance only; and has no effect on
its profile.
36 Great Claw*: One of the mutant's arms ends in a great, crab-like
claw. He may carry no weapons in this arm, but gains an extra
attack in hand-to-hand combat with a +1 Strength bonus.
41 Hideous: The mutant causes fear, and is seldom invited to
parties.
42 Horns*: The mutant's head grows horns, and it gains an extra
gore attack in hand-to-hand combat at the mutant's normal Strength
The mutant may no longer wear a helmet.
43 Iron Hard Skin*: The mutant's skin is covered in iron and steel
scales. The mutant's armour save is improved by +1 (i.e. a 5+ save
becomes a 4+). Note that a warrior's armour save may never
improve to better than a 1+ save. If the mutant has no armour, their
skin alone gives them a 6+ armour save.
44 Mace Tail*: The mutant grows a flexible tail with a mace-like
bony tip. Unless it already has a tail, the mutant gains an extra tail
attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase at the mutant's Strength
+1. If the mutant already has a tail, it will have to decide at the
beginning of each hand-to-hand phase which tail it wishes to use.
45 Moronic: The mutant's mind shrinks. The mutant is now subject
to stupidity.
46 Plague Bearer*: The mutant carries a hideous, Chaos-tainted
disease. The mutant's limbs are covered in open sores, and the
mutant is dramatically weakened by its condition.
Reduce the mutant's Movement and Initiative by -1. Any time the
mutant hits an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, there is a chance they
have infected their foe with this debilitating disease: the enemy
model must roll equal to or less than its Toughness on a D6 to avoid
contracting the sickness. If the roll is higher than the model's
Toughness, they suffer the -1 to Movement and Initiative penalty for
the rest of the battle, (after which it is assumed they get immediate
herbal remedies and plenty of rest to keep the disease from setting in
permanently!). The Plague Bearer may not infect the same model
more than once in a single battle. In addition, the Plague Bearer's
ghastly appearance means it now causes fear.
```
Assembled By Paul H Page 313 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


51 Poisonous Bite: The mutant grows small fangs which can secrete
a potent poison.
Unless the warrior already has a bite attack, it gains an extra attack
in each hand-to-hand combat phase due to its deadly bite. The
poisonous bite is a Strength 5 attack, but is reduced to Strength 2 if
the target of the bite is immune to poison. If the mutant already
possesses a bite attack, it is simply upgraded to include the
poisonous effect described above.
52 Prehensile Tail*: The mutant grows a prehensile tail. Unless the
mutant already has a tail attack, he gains an additional attack with
this tail in each hand-to-hand combat phase. The mutant may hold
and use any singlehanded weapon in the tail, or alternatively, he
may carry and use a shield or buckler with it. If a mutant with other
tail attacks does use an equipped prehensile tail in a hand-to-hand
combat phase, he may not use any of his other tail attacks during
that phase; a single tail must be selected for use at the beginning of
each hand-to-hand phase. If a mutant unable to use weaponry (i.e.
Possessed, Chaos Spawn, etc.) gains this mutation, they simply gain
an extra attack (unless they already possess a tail attack); they
remain unable to use weapons.
53 Regeneration: The mutant can often heal instantly from wounds
it suffers in battle. When the mutant suffers one or more Wounds, it
may try to regenerate the damage. Roll a D6: on the roll of a 4+, the
mutant has instantly healed itself back to full Wounds. If less than a
4 is rolled, the mutant's regenerative powers have been temporarily
exhausted, and it may not attempt further regenerations for the
remainder of the battle.
54 Resilient: The mutant's skin thickens, or becomes scaly, or
otherwise increases its resilience to damage. Increase the mutant's
Toughness by +1.

```
55 Scorpion Tail*: The mutant has a long barbed tail with an
envenomed tip, allowing him to make an extra Strength 5 attack in
each hand-to-hand combat phase (unless the mutant already has a
tail attack, in which case it will have to select a single one of its
available tail attacks in each hand-to-hand phase). If the model hit
by the tail is immune to poison, the Strength of the hit is reduced to
2.
56 Skull Face*: The flesh of the mutant's face dissolves, leaving a
skull. The mutant now causes fear.
61 Spines*: Any model in base contact with the mutant suffers an
automatic Strength 1 hit at the beginning of each close combat
phase. Spines will never cause critical hits.
62 Stunted: The mutant's body becomes hunchbacked and stiffened.
Reduce the mutant's Movement and Initiative by -1.
63 Suckers*: The mutant's limbs are covered in adhesive suckers.
The mutant automatically passes Initiative tests when climbing.
64 Tentacle*: One of the mutant's arms ends in a tentacle. He may
grapple his opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks by -1,
down to a minimum of 1. The mutant may decide which attack his
opponent loses.
65 Warts: The mutant is covered in repellent warts. The mutant's
profile is unaffected.
66 Wings*: The mutant grows a pair of feathered or bat-like wings.
The wings are not strong enough to allow the mutant to fly in the
proper sense, but they do allow the mutant to glide down from an
elevated position. If the mutant is above the table-top surface (on a
roof, walkway, etc.) it may glide down at a rate of 2" horizontally
for each inch of downward vertical movement.

#### Encampments

These rules are based from the ones by Steven Gibbs
Since the cataclysm that smashed the city of Mordheim, crude shantytowns have cropped up beyond the crumbling city walls. At first these
pitiful settlements housed the sparse remnants of Mordheim’s population. However, as soon as word reached the other towns and cities of
the Empire of the magical Wyrdstone that could be found in the blackened shell of Mordheim, the treasure seekers came. The existing
settlements were practically overrun by bands of mercenaries and bandits who would set up their camps in whatever tumbledown buildings
were available or pitch their tents behind crude barricades. Soon there was a flood of greedy souls, many of which were not human as the
stench of Wyrdstone tempted many from afar.
There are three main settlements in and around Mordheim. Sigmarhaven is inhabited mainly by the loyal followers of Sigmar and is a place
of law and relative order. It also attracts a large following of Witch Hunters and their ilk, and understandably mutants and the Possessed are
not tolerated there. Paid and equipped watchmen are maintained for the security of those who camp within it. There are, though, far more
lawless settlements around Mordheim where scum such as Orcs and even the Possessed are known to walk freely. Nowhere is more infamous
than thrice cursed Cutthroat’s Den. Here life is cheap and the only law is that of the sword. Although a foul and dangerous place, there are
many things that can be bought and sold here because of the shady sorts this place attracts. The last place even the toughest, most brutal of
scum would think twice before making their camp there is within the haunted ruins of Mordheim itself. The dead are said to walk here and
the foul servants of the Shadow Lord are everywhere, waiting to claim the souls of the unwary. There are those, however, that brave the
mutant infested cursed city even after nightfall but then again they seem quite suited to it. Foul Ratmen scurry about the sewers,
Necromancers make their homes, confidant that the foolish righteous won’t disturb their unholy practices and, of course, the children of the
Shadow Lord, the Possessed, claim the ruins as their domain.

##### Experimental Rules

When starting a new campaign, all players must decide or not
to use the encampment rules. Only after their first battle may
each player then try to find a settlement and make camp.
First, they must decide which of the settlements they wish to
set up camp in (obviously dependent upon which settlements
will let them in!) or if they want to risk actually staying in the
cursed city. When you decide where you want them to stay.
A warband may only have one camp at a time and may only
reroll for a new camp if they lose their original one or they
have upgraded to a new site after three rounds. Any effects
that a camp provides start after the warband’s next battle.
After each battle you may find out if you gain income, if
other warriors join the warband, or if repairs need be made to
the camp.
After each battle you may choose to visit locations within the
settlement to procure goods and entertainment. If you don’t,
you may use the Trading chart as normal. Different locations
can help you find items, receive healing, make money or
other things. Between location visits, you must roll on the
Events table to find out what happens to the warband as it
carouses around the town.

##### Special Rules

```
Warband Size: With a camp to call home many warriors
will come knotting. The size of the warband may increase to
three times greater than the warband’s maximum starting
size. Also your warband may have up to twice the number of
marked heroes (other than the Leader) and henchmen groups,
also you may have up to 5 model with the ‘Lad’s Got Talent’,
However the normal maximum on a warband will apply
when fighting a Scenario (only if Scenario: Defend the
Camp, then the whole warband may be used.)
Upkeep Cost: Any Hired Sword which is left behind at the
encampment will only charge haft the standard upkeep for
that battle. Hired swords that are recovering from wounds
may only charge haft the standard upkeep, roll a D6 for each
wounded Hired Sword on a 4+ he will not charge for upkeep.
Any Dramatis Personae will not wait around in some camp,
so if a Dramatis Personae if left behind they will leave the
warband.
```

##### Types of Encampment

Barracks: The Barracks are used by most of the Human
warbands, Any Mercenaries warbands increasing the
maximum number of warband member by +1 model.
Caves: There are many caves found all around Mordheim,
and most of these caves are home to some sort of monsters.
The caves are commonly used by the Beastmen raiders and
Green-skins warbands. But the Cults of the Possessed also
have been known to uses the caves. Beastmen raiders may
recruit a Minotaur at haft the normal price. Green-skins may
recruit a Troll at haft the normal price. If the cave is used by
any other warbands, then on every other game, Roll a d6, on
a 5+ you have to defend against: Beastmen raiders, Green-
skins, or Possessed warband.
Cellars: When the building above is burn away the cellar is
all that is left. With no one left to rebuild, the cellars become
places of refuges of many warbands, been underground the

warbands may have D3 extra giant rats for free.
Churches: The church is a holy place for many warbands
and for some an unholy place. Witch Hunter & Sister of
Sigmar warbands may have D3 vile of Holy water every
game, Any human warbands (non-chaotic), dwarven
warbands or elven warbands may hire a Cleric, Warrior Priest
or Wolf Priest at haft the normal hiring cost, upkeep is as
normal. The church may be fitted with bell tower. This act as
a scout tower and have the following special rule:
Church Bells - Then defending the base camp, the defender may
ring the church bells at the start of the assault phase. If rung all
defending model gain a +1 Initiative and cause fear for that turn
(this may be rung in the attacker’s turn). At the end of turn roll a D6
on a 5+ the bell breaks from it mountings, the bell cannot be used
for the rest of the game, and will cost 25 gold crown to repair and
the upkeep increases by +2D6 for each time the bell breaks.
Crypt/Mausoleum: You have found a graveyard to your
liking. With nice mausoleums and plenty of corpses. The
grave corpses tend to be better preserved and good for
reanimating, this encampment has the following special rule:
Grave Robbing - The income of a warband that set up in a
Crypt/Mausoleum and Grave Robbing will increase to 3D6. Undead
warbands will dig up suitable corpses on a 9 or less.

```
Farmhouse: In your meandering you have found a deserted
farm. Your warband may work it to earn some extra cash, this
encampment has the following special rule:
Working the land - The income of a warband that set up in a Farm
and Working the land will increase to 2D3 and will gain +1
Experience on a 5 or 6.
Guardhouse: Normally Guardhouse are made out of stone

The Guardhouse gives your warband the advantage of having
a high place to shoot from and Counts as hard cover (-2).
House: the House is just that, a house with three (maybe
four) walls and sometimes a roof.
Manor: In your meandering you have found a Manor. Your
warband has taken it over and fixed it up to your liking.
Merchants see the house as a sign of wealth and are more apt
to stop by to sell their wares. Add +2 to find items roll on the
trading chart.
Safe House (Sister of Sigmar only): The Save Houses are
only used be the Sister of Sigmar. The house comes with a
fence, wall or some other barrier to keep out riffraff. The Safe
House gives the Sister of Sigmar warband one reroll per
battle.
Sewers: You have found a lovely section of sewer to set up
camp in. It even has some nice tunnels running off of it to
who knows where. Skaven may have an extra rat ogre.
Allows up to three Henchmen group to be held in reserve at
the start of the game and placed anywhere on the board at the
start of your turn - no closer than 8" to an enemy model,
Sewer sickness - Roll a D6 for each person staying here on a 1 they
are sick and can’t fight in the next game. Skaven roll 2D6 and on a
12 they can’t fight.
Tavern: You have gotten your warband a deed to a Tavern.
You get to earn extra cash for renting out rooms and selling
food, but have become more noticeable as a warband. This
encampment has the following special rule:

##### Income

The warbands can be supplement their income, members of a
warband which stay behind can work to gain extra income or
other benefits for the warband. Recovering warband members
cannot work. The some jobs that a warband can do, is based
on location of encampment, type of encampment and type of
warband.
Working the land: Any member of the warband may work
the common farmland, for each member of the warband
which work the land get D3 GC for their time and roll D6 for
each hero/henchmen group and on a 6 they gain +1
Experience.
Part of the Watch: Any member of the warband may help
out the City Watch for a day, for each hero/henchmen group
helping the City Watch gains 30 GC for their trouble. If a
warband get in trouble with the City Watch roll at the start of
the next time your warband meets on a 5+ the enemy
warband hate your warband. Note that this will only applies
for that one game.

```
##### Hired Help

from the locals to employ their skills for the warband. Your
warband may get the help from a displace Beast Handle,
Blacksmith, Cartographer, Fletcher, or Gunsmith. Each hired

##### Locations

After each battle you may choose to visit locations within the
settlement to procure goods and entertainment. If you don’t,
you may use the Trading chart as normal. Different locations
can help you find items, receive healing, make money or
other things. Between location visits you must roll on the
Events table to find out what happens to the warband as it
carouses around the town.

A Visit to the Apothecary
Each warrior may only attempt to get treatment for one injury
at a time, and only one attempt at treatment per Hero may be
made during each post battle sequence. The cost for treatment
will vary from location to location per attempt (one attempt =
one roll on the table), and this money must be paid before
rolling on the table – Mordheim physicians demand payment
in advance, while the patient is still capable of doing so!
When you visit an Apothecary you may add +1 to find the
drugs or potions that you are looking for.
Necromancers often visit the surgeon looking for body parts
and bodies for their creations and zombies. A necromancer
may stop by the surgeon to find bodies for zombies and
reanimate them. Roll a d6 if you roll a 6 you may add a
zombie to your warband at 1/2 the cost.
The following injuries cannot be treated: Chest Wound,
Blinded in One Eye, and Old Battle Wound. They are
permanent damage the afflicted warrior will carry to his
grave.
The following injuries use the Limb Surgery table: Leg
Wound, Smashed Leg, and Hand Injury.
The following injuries use the Brain Surgery table:
Madness and Nervous Condition.

```
Surgery table
2D6 Result
2-3 ‘Someone fetch a priest!’
The unfortunate patient has expired due to excessive blood
loss. The Hero is dead and must be stricken from the
warband record, but his equipment is retained by the
warband.
4 ‘This has got to come off!’
The surgeon has felt the need to amputate, ostensibly to
‘keep the rot out’. If a leg was being treated, the model now
has its Movement halved (rounding up); if a hand was being
treated, the warrior may only use a single-handed weapon
from now on.
5-6 ‘Sorry, lad!' Done my best!’
The surgery was unsuccessful, and the warrior must miss the
next battle while he recovers.
7-8 ‘No luck!’
The surgery was unsuccessful.
9-10 ‘Mind you stay off it for a bit!’
The surgery was successful! The warrior may remove the
injury and its adverse effects from his profile. He must,
however, miss the next battle while he recovers.
11-12 ‘Shallaya be praised!’
The surgery was a complete success! The warrior may
remove the injury and its adverse effects from his profile.

Brain Surgery table
2D6 Result
2-3 ‘Someone fetch a priest!’
The physician has been a bit too zealous in his treatment.
The Hero is dead and must be stricken from the warband
record, but his equipment is retained by the warband.
4-5 ‘Erm... that’s not right!’
The treatment has not only failed to help the warrior, it has
actually worsened his condition! The warrior is now subject
to Stupidity. If the warrior was being treated for Stupidity,
there is no change in his condition (except perhaps, a bit
more drooling than usual).
6 ‘A bit unhinged, that one!’
The treatment has failed, and the warrior emerges from the
treatment as something of a raving lunatic. The warrior
suffers a -1 Initiative penalty (down to a minimum of 1). He
is now so unsettling to behold that he causes fear.
7-8 ‘Sorry lad! Done my best!’
The treatment was unsuccessful, and the warrior must miss
the next battle while he recovers.
9-10 ‘A bit of rest, and you’ll be fine!’
The treatment was successful! The warrior may remove the
injury and its adverse effects from his profile. He must,
however, miss the next battle while he recovers.
11-12 ‘Shallaya be praised!’
The treatment was a complete success! The warrior may
remove the injury and its adverse effects from his profile.

Cartographer
A cartographer will help the band with their exploration. He
also carries many different maps. You may purchase maps
here without searching for them but the rules for maps from
the Mordheim rulebook still apply. The cartographer is also a
wealth of little titbits of information that he is willing to sell.
Most of it is useless but some isn’t. If you pay him 5 GC he
will divulge some of this info to you.
Roll a D6 on the following chart:
1 You may re-roll one of your Exploration dice after the next
battle.
2-5 The information was interesting but utterly useless.
6 You may increase or decrease the result of one Exploration
dice by 1 after the next battle.

Fletcher
The fletcher is a master at making bows and arrows, along
with other missile weapons. He does not have the craft or
know how to create Black Powder weapons though. When
you visit a fletcher you may add +2 to find the missile

```
weapon you are looking for (this does not count towards
Black Powder weapons though).
Smithy
Hearty blacksmiths work at the smithy where they fashion all
kinds of metals into a variety of useful items. Mainly though
they create weapons and armour. When visiting a blacksmith
you may add +2 to your Search rolls when trying to find
armour or close combat weapons.
Muleskinner
A beast master takes care of the animals. He feeds, houses
and trains horses, ponies and dogs. He reduces the difficulty
of finding animals by adding +2 to your dice roll on the
Trading chart.
Merchant
The merchant is a purveyor of a great variety of goods. He
sells just about anything that’s not nailed down. The
merchant gives you +1 to find Rare items.

Drinking Den
This is a tavern where you may play a game of chance, look for new recruits or just get smashed! You may gamble at any time
in the Dancing Pig. To find out what else you can do, roll a D6 and consult the following chart.
D6 Effects
1 Drugged. One of your Heroes (select randomly) partakes of
a curious drink offered to him by a stranger. After one swig
he feels the effect of the liquid take hold – he has been
drugged! Roll a D6 on the following table:
1-3 Your Hero has been poisoned and is at -1 Toughness
for the duration of the next battle.
4-6 The liquid in question is actually a very strong ale, and
your hero quickly gains a taste for it. He wakes up the
next morning with a pounding head.
2-3 Taken with the joys of hot food and a good too many bottles
of Bugman’s, your leader and his men overspend on such
luxuries by D6x10 GC.
4-5 Hireling. Whilst carousing in the bar you meet many
different characters and warriors. You sit down to have a
few drinks with some. Roll a D6 on the following chart:
1 You are drinking with a Halfling who, impressed with
your propensity for ale, offers you his services at half
the normal rate for the next battle.
2 An Ogre challenges you to a drinking contest. Roll a
D6:
1-4 He drinks you under the table – you wake the next
day with a terrible hangover.
5-6 You drink him under the table and he is in such
awe that he offers you his services for the next
battle for free.
3 You sit down with a mysterious Elven Ranger and
start to tell tales of your exploits. One of your tales
moves him so much, he offers you his services at half
the cost for the next battle.
4 You sit down and share a drink with a Freelancer. As
the night wears on you find that he and your father
served in the same company together. He offers you
his services for the next battle for free.
5 You find yourself drinking with a young fellow who is
itching to test his metal in the Cursed City – you may
add an extra henchman to your party (not above your
warband’s maximum number of warriors however).
6 You sit with a fellow who looks battle hardened. As
you talk, you discover that the rest of his warband was
slain searching the ruins. You may ask him to join
your warband as a Hero. You may add a Hero to your
warband for free, although only if you haven’t got the
maximum number of Heroes already.
6 Bar Room Brawl. Your leader gets into an argument with
another patron in the tavern. The argument soon escalates
quickly. Roll a D6 on the following table:
1 Your leader is thrashed and must make an immediate
roll on the Injury table.
2 Your leader takes quite a beating and leaves D6 GC
poorer.
3 Your leader knocks the patron to the ground and takes
D6x3 GC from his purse for his impudence.
4 The patron is joined by his warband and an all-out
brawl ensues. Roll a D6: 1-4 you send the warband
fleeing and gain D6x5 GC, for your trouble. 5-6 you
are routed and lose D6x5 GC
5 The brawl attracts the attention of the watch, who
arrive to throw the patron in the stocks.
6 The brawl attracts the attention of the watch who
arrive to throw everyone into the stocks. You must pay
D6x10 GC to get everyone out.

```
Gambling
Your leader gets involved in a rather dubious game of dice.
Roll a D6 and consult the table below:
D6 Result
1 Your leader loses 3D6 GC and comes away a little wiser.
2-5 Your leader manages to break even.
6 Your leader gambles away a fortune before Lady Luck
smiles on him and he wins it all back with interest. Collect
3D6 GC in winnings.

##### Sigmarhaven

Sigmarhaven, bastion of hope and goodwill, is located to the
north-east of Mordheim where the River Stir still runs pure. It
is not the largest of the settlements around Mordheim but is
by far the safest. The settlement is surrounded by a wooden
palisade and has a well-armed militia, which is paid for and
maintained by tithes from all of the warbands that reside
there.
Sigmarhaven was originally founded by the Sigmar-fearing
folk who managed to flee the cursed city but has since
become the refuge of Witch Hunters and Reiklanders alike. A
makeshift wooden temple stands in the centre of this shanty
of wooden shacks and canvas tents, and the priests of Sigmar
preside over the settlement and deal with the day-to-day
running of the place. The centre of the settlement is a bustling
market place where traders and merchants can buy and sell
their wares – everything from food, ale and weapons to
horses and even Wyrdstone. Most honest, decent folk are
welcomed here from many of the Empire’s outlying
provinces, and even the odd Elf or Dwarf can be found
wandering around the morass of camps.
Who may camp here: The Warbands which are allowed the
stay inside the wall of Sigmarhaven are of a Lawful, Lawful /
Neutral or Neutral Alignment, apart from the Outlaw, Pit
Fighter and Norse Warbands.
Housing: Most of Sigmarhaven housing is of tents or small
wooden shacks, when a new warbands arrives they are
assigned a block, it is up the warband’s leader to work out
how to best use the block.
Apothecary Cost: 20 gold crowns per attempt
Special Rules:
Upkeep: For any warband residing within Sigmarhaven is
responsible for the upkeep and defence of the place – as a
result a tithe of two shards of Wyrdstone must be paid after
each battle.

```

Middenheimers abound here as do Witch Hunters. Some

(after all it is too filthy for them). The Sisters have a presence
here but it is only a safe house. Possessed are a rare site but
do appear at times.
Who may camp here: Most Warbands are welcome the stay
at Brigandsburg apart from the Beastmen raiders.
Housing: Most of Brigandsburg housing is of tents or
wooden shacks,

##### Cutthroat’s Den

Cutthroat’s Den is a place of villainy and evil. It is located on
the west side of Mordheim. Anyone with gold is allowed in
and those without tend to find their hands in other people's
pockets.
Cutthroat’s Den does not have much in the range of defence
(it is up to the warband to defence themself). As for the City
Watch, it works for the City’s Crime boss and would only
defence itself.
There are a few brave souls (or fools as some have said) that
stay in Cutthroat to make money. The famous Twisted Goat
is located here. Despite being in a bad town the owner keeps
it clean and safe as brawls are at a minimum. The infamous
Pit resides in the centre of town. Many have lost their lives
here and many have made their fortunes. The slaver Ashen
Pettyflesh has a thriving business here. He sales any
humanoid for a price to anyone with the right amount of
money. When visiting Cutthroat’s Den you may find many
special locations. You may choose to skip visiting locations
and use the trading chart to get equipment.
Who may camp here: The warbands that are welcome (kind
of) at Cutthroat’s Den are Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral /
Chaotic, Chaotic Alignment, apart from the Beastmen
raiders.

tents or haft stone/wood buildings.
