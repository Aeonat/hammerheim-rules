### Optional Rules

This section includes a variety of rules that add an extra
dimension to your battles in Mordheim. As they are additions
to the basic rules they are not an essential part of the game,
and you should agree with your opponent beforehand
whether you are going to use any of them.
We recommend that new players ignore this section to begin
with, at least until you are familiar with the way the game
works. If you consider yourself to be an experienced gamer
then you’ll have no problem incorporating these elements.
Some of these additional rules alter the game quite
dramatically, and you are under no obligation to use any of
them. They have simply been included for players who want
to explore different aspects of the game.

#### Escaping from combat

Warriors that are engaged in hand-to-hand combat at the start
of their own turn may try to escape from combat during their
movement phase. Such fighters are assumed to have realised
that the odds are against them and decided that it is just too
dangerous for them to continue.
Declare which of your warriors will try to escape from
combat at the start of your movement phase, at the same time
as you declare charges. Turn the models around to show this.
Take a Leadership test for each warrior trying to escape from
combat. This represents his efforts to find the right time to
escape. If he passes, the warrior can move up to double his
normal Movement rate away from combat and the enemy he
was fighting, in any direction.

If he fails, his opponent is allowed to make 1 automatic hit
against the warrior who is trying to escape, and the fleeing
warrior (provided he survives) will run 2D6" directly away
from combat. He will have to take a Leadership test at the
beginning of his next turn.
If successful he will stop, but may not do anything else
during that turn. If the test is failed, he will continue to run
2D6" towards the closest table edge and must test again the
following turn if he is still on the table.
If a warrior is charged whilst he is fleeing, the charger is
moved into base contact with him as normal, but the fleeing
warrior will then immediately run a further 2D6" towards the
table edge, before any blows can be struck.
#### Rewards of the Shadowlord

When a Magister or Mutant from a Possessed warband has accumulated enough experience, instead of picking a skill,
he may roll on the Rewards table below. This represents the pilgrimage of the Mutant or Magister to the Pit, where he
can beseech a favour from the Shadowlord himself. Roll 2D6.
2 Wrath of the Shadowlord! The warrior is mutated
beyond recognition and vanishes into the ruins,
joining the many other horrors that roam Mordheim.
3-6 Nothing Happens. The capricious Shadowlord
ignores the pleas of his servant.
7-8 Mutation. The warrior develops a severe mutation.
Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 you lose a single point from
one of your warrior’s characteristics (chosen by
you), due to atrophy, or some such degrading
mutation. On a roll of 2 or more you may choose
which one of the mutations listed in the Cult of the
Possessed Warbands section your warrior has been
rewarded with.
9-10 Chaos Armor. The warrior’s body becomes
encrusted with an arcane, all enveloping suit of
armor. This confers a basic 4+ save, but does not
affect the model’s ability to cast spells or move in
any way.

11 Daemon Weapon. The warrior receives a weapon
with a bound Daemon inside it. This weapon adds
+1 to his Strength in close combat, grants a +1
bonus on all to hit rolls using it. The user may
choose the weapon’s form (a sword, an axe, etc),
though it will not have any of the special abilities
normally associated with common weapons of that
type. An axe with a bound Daemon, for example,
will not benefit from the usual extra save modifier.
12 Possessed! A Daemon takes over the soul and body
of the warrior. He immediately gains +1 Weapon
Skill, +1 Strength, +1 Attacks and +1 Wounds.
These increases do not count towards his maximum
characteristics. The warrior loses D3 of his skills
(chosen by the player) and may no longer use
weapons or armor, except for Chaos Armor or
Daemon weapons.

#### Mounted Warriors

By Robert J. Walker and Roger Latham
Horses are rare and expensive in Mordheim, but they do allow warriors to move quickly, so as long as the steed stays on the
streets and does not venture into the ruined buildings, where it could easily stumble and fall. By using the following rules, you
can include mounted Heroes in your games.

##### Model Representation

If you wish to include riding beasts or tamed animals you
will need to have models to represent them. For mounted
warriors you will need both a mounted miniature and a model
on foot. It is advised not to glue the rider on but to use ‘blue-
tack’ or something similar so that he may be removed when
on foot and his mount is unridden.

##### Riding Animals

Most warriors in Mordheim can only dream of owning a
riding animal. Expensive to buy, expensive to keep and
requiring skill to ride, they are a mark of status beyond the
reach of lowly henchmen. To those with the necessary wealth
and skill, however, they are a priceless possession, enabling
their rider to move rapidly across the battlefield, aiding him
in combat with an advantage of height and weight, and in
some cases, fighting in their own right.

##### Mounted models in Mordheim

A warrior and his horse are treated in all respects as a single
model. Should the rider be taken out of action, then the entire
model is removed from the battle.
Mounted warriors use the rider’s Leadership value for all
Leadership-based tests. When the warrior is attacked, use the
rider’s Toughness and Wounds.
In close combat, a warhorse can make 1 attack, but a normal
horse has no Attacks characteristic and therefore does not
attack in close combat.
Armor, called barding, may be purchased for a warhorse,
(refer to the Trading chart). It adds a further +1 bonus to the
model’s armor save, but subtracts one from its Movement.
A normal horse may not wear barding. A barded warhorse is
only killed on a serious injury roll of ‘1’ if the model goes
out of action.

##### Special Rules

Mounting Animals: It requires a full move to mount or
dismount a riding creature and the rider may not shoot or cast
magic whilst doing so. A mount or its rider may not run or
charge in the same turn that the warrior mounts or dismounts
unless the rider has a Cavalry Skill that allows this.
Not Indoors: Mounts cannot normally be ridden indoors or
underground, unless playing a specially devised scenario that
allows this.
Dense Terrain: Riding mounts are rare both amongst the
ruins of Mordheim and in the claustrophobic jungles of
Lustria. The dense terrain makes riding difficult and large
numbers of riders are highly ineffective. Thus in those
settings a warband may only have a maximum of two mounts
(not including those belonging to Hired Swords). In more
open settings, such as the open fields in the countryside
around Mordheim or the deserts of Khemri, a warband may
have as many mounts as they can afford.
Controlling a Mount: The Cavalry Skills may be used by
warriors who have a riding animal, but only after the skill
Ride has been gained; warriors which come provided with a
riding animal are assumed to possess the Ride skill already.

Warriors without this skill may still ride animals, but must
test against their Leadership if hit by any missile and at the
beginning of any combat phase when a standing enemy is in
base contact. If the test is failed they lose control of their
mount and must roll on the Whoa, Boy! Table (see below).
Note if an enemy is not standing, the mounted warrior is not
considered to be in combat and thus does not need to test for
loss of control.
Two Weapon Fighting: Mounted warriors may not fight
with two weapons, although a shield or buckler may be used
as normal. Two-handed weapons are not permitted. The use
of a pistol in the first round of hand-to-hand combat replaces
the model’s usual weapon.
Armor Bonus: All riding animals give their riders a +1
armor save bonus.
Bolting Mounts: In certain circumstances, a mount may bolt.
A bolting mount must make a Leadership test at the
beginning of the owning player’s turn; if successful it stops
running, otherwise it continues fleeing. The easiest way to
determine the direction a mount bolts is to use an scatter dice.
If you do not have one, then roll 2D6 and use the clock-face
method. Taking the direction the horse is facing as 12 and
directly behind as 6, the horse will bolt in the appropriate
direction on the clock-face.
Stunned Riders: Stunned riders will fall from their mounts
as indicated on the Whoa Boy! Table. Mounts which
subsequently bolt may be remounted should the warrior make
base contact with the horse before it leaves the table. Note
that whether the mount leaves the table or not, it will be
recovered unscathed after the battle.
Leading Animals: On occasion, a warrior may want to lead
a riding animal rather than riding it. A warrior may only lead
one riding animal unless he has the Animal Handling skill,
for that particular animal, in which case he can lead as many
as he wishes. Groups of led animals are tethered together and
must maintain base contact with each other; at least one must
be in base contact with the warrior leading them. Riding
animals that are being led do not roll for loss of control. If
required to make a Leadership test (e.g. when attacked by a
fear causing enemy) they use the Ld of the warrior leading
them. A warrior leading riding animals may move and fight
as normal, but must maintain base contact at all times.
Unled Animals: Riding animals which are not being either
led or ridden will remain stationary but must make a
Leadership test at the beginning of their turn. If this is failed,
they will bolt, using the rules above.
Jumping: A horse or warhorse may jump over an obstacle up
to 2" in height with no movement penalty.
Shooting at mounted warriors: Because of the size of a
mounted warrior, any shooter may always pick one as a
target, even if there are enemies closer.
Targeting Mounted Warriors: Enemies may not target a
ridden horse, whether by missiles or in hand-to-hand combat.
The rider will always be seen as the greater threat. Due to
their prominence, any mounted warrior may always be
Assembled By Paul H Page 293 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


chosen as a target by a shooter even if there are enemies
closer. However the shooters do NOT gain +1 to hit - the
rider is still the same size as before.
Mounts and campaigns: If a mounted warrior is taken out of
action, roll a D6 after the battle. On a 1-2, the mount is killed
and removed from the warband roster.

##### Losing Control

If a mounted warrior is wounded, then the player must roll on
the Whoa Boy! Table. This replaces the normal injuries chart.
If critical hits are suffered then roll as many times as are
required, taking the most serious result.

##### Whoa Boy! Table

1-2 The rider is temporarily disorientated and his mount rears
up. The rider keeps his seat but must spend his next turn
stationary regaining control, unable to move or shoot. If
attacked, treat the rider as fallen down.
3-4 The rider falls off his mount and is stunned, taking an
additional S2 hit in the process with no armor save. In
addition, roll 1D6: on a roll of 1-3, the mount immediately
bolts 3D6" in a random direction and continues until it has
left the table – the mount may be recovered after the battle;
on a roll of 4-6, the mount remains stationary and the
warrior may remount once recovered. Note: the mount does
not count as unridden or unled in this instance.
5-6 The rider and his mount crash to the ground together. The
rider and mount are automatically out of action. In addition,
roll a D6: on a roll of 1-2 the mount lands on top of its rider,
crushing him. If this happens the warrior must roll twice on
the serious injuries chart after the battle. In addition, after
the battle roll a D6: on a roll of 1-2 the mount was crippled
or killed by the fall and removed from the warband roster.

#### Vehicles of the Empire

From The Empire in Flames
There are three principal modes of transport in the Empire: travel by boat, by riding animals, such as horses and mules, and
travel by wagon or coach. Riding animals have already been covered above. Here we will cover the rules for travel via boat
and wagon.

##### Wagons

This covers carts, stagecoaches and all two- and four-wheeled
forms of transport commonly found in the Empire.
Movement
A wagon’s movement is determined by how laden it is with
passengers and cargo. Therefore throughout a game, a
wagon’s move may alter due to unloading or loading up of
more passengers and cargo. Consult the table below to
determine movement. Wagons cannot charge, climb, hide,
run or flee.
Turns
Wagons, regardless of size, may make a single turn of up to
45 degrees at the end of its movement. It may then apply the
lash if desired. Make turns by pivoting the vehicle from its
mid-point.
Applying the Lash!
There are many reasons why a wagon driver would want to
urge his beasts to go faster – if he is being pursued by bandits
or mutants, for example! By applying the lash to his draft
beasts, the driver of a wagon can attempt to gain some extra
movement. After the wagon has moved normally, the player
may roll a D6. On the score of 2+ this indicates how many
extra inches the wagon may move ahead in a straight line. On
the roll of a 1 something drastic has happened. Roll on the
table below:
D6 Result
1-2 Steeds Tiring – The draft animals are growing tired – if the
driver applies the lash next turn you must halve the score
rounding fractions up.
3-4 Driver Shaken – Due to the wagon’s speed the driver is
thrown all over the place and may not apply the lash next
turn as he recovers his composure.
5-6 Out of control – Make a roll on the Out of Control
Wagon Movement
No. of passengers / cargo quota Applying the lash!
Standard Movement
1 (driver – compulsory) 10 +D6
2-3 8 +D6
4-6 6 +D6

Terrain
Difficult Ground: If a wagon enters difficult ground roll a
D6. On a score of a 1 immediately make a roll on the Out of
Control table, otherwise the wagon is fine.
Very Difficult Ground: If a wagon enters very difficult
ground immediately make a roll on the Out of Control table
with a modifier of +1.
Walls/Obstacles: If a wagon collides with a wall or other
solid obstacle it comes to an immediate halt. The wagon
suffers D3 hits at a Strength of 7 (see below).
Impassable Ground: If a wagon moves onto impassable
ground it is immediately destroyed and each crew
member/draft animal must make an Injury roll. Remove the
wagon and place any surviving crew within 3" of the crash
site.

Collisions
If a wagon collides with another wagon both suffer D3
Strength 7 hits (roll location and damage as normal below).
In the case that either attackers or defenders block the way of
a wagon and it cannot move around them then the wagon will
move through the models, even if they are from the defending
warband. All of the models touched by a wagon that is forced
to move through them must roll lower or equal to their
Initiative or suffer a S4 hit with all of the consequences.
Warriors that are out of action cannot get out of the way of a
wagon and are therefore automatically hit. Whenever a
wagon collides with anything roll a D6, on a score of a 1
make an Out of Control test.
Transport
For the sake of simplicity all wagons and coaches may
transport up to six human-sized warriors or smaller (let’s be
having no Ogre wagoneers now!) or the equivalent in cargo
(this will be covered in greater detail in the Scenarios
section). One crewman must be allocated as the driver and
one may ‘ride shotgun’ with him. The driver may do nothing
else but drive whilst the wagon is moving as he is too busy
controlling the reins. In the event that the driver is knocked
down, stunned or taken out of action a crew member riding
shotgun may take over the reins and become the new driver.
Mounting/Dismounting
A friendly warrior may board a stationary wagon by simply
moving into contact with it (wagons are only considered
stationary if they didn’t move in their last turn). Place the
model either on the wagon or move it with the wagon in base
contact to simulate it being transported. Similarly, a warrior
may dismount from a stationary wagon by moving away
from contact. Warriors may attempt to mount or dismount
from a moving wagon by passing an Initiative test. If they
fail, they take falling damage of D3 automatic hits at a
Strength equal to half the vehicle’s speed. Warriors may
attempt to board a moving wagon from either another moving
wagon or from a moving mount with a modifier of -1 to their
Initiative test – this counts as a charge.
Losing Control of the Draft Animals
Apart from if a wagon becomes a runaway, control may also
be lost by attackers attempting to wrestle away the control of
the draft animals from the driver. Apart from eliminating the
driver and taking control of the reins, the easiest way to
control the draft animals is for a warrior to leap onto the back
of one and ride it. A warrior can successfully leap onto a draft
animal by passing an Initiative test (the warrior may add +1 if
they have the Ride skill). If the test is failed then the warrior
takes falling damage as usual. The warrior must pass a
Leadership test to control the beast and therefore control the
direction and speed of the wagon. The driver can only wrestle
back control of the wagon by eliminating the warrior (any
injury will suffice). If a warrior has successfully mounted a
draft animal he may attempt to cut it free from the team on a
4+ although he will lose control of the wagon itself in doing
so.

Shooting
Shooting from a wagon: Crew may fire from aboard a
wagon and have a 360 degree arc of fire. Shooters suffer a
penalty of -1 to hit for firing from a moving surface.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Wagon - - - - 8 4 - - -
Wheel - - - - 6 1 - - -
Horse 8 - - 3 3 1 3 - -
Horse 6 - - 3 3 1 2 - -
Shooting at a wagon: Warriors may shoot at a vehicle and
gain a +1 to hit because it is a large target. If a hit is scored
against a wagon then a roll must be made on the Location
table opposite to decide what part of the vehicle has been hit.
Loss of a Draft Creature
Any time a steed is hit, regardless of whether or not it is
injured, make a roll on the Out of Control table. If a steed is
stunned or knocked down it will be dragged along by its
associates until it recovers – next turn reduce speed by 1/2
(with a draft of two animals) or 1/4 (with a draft of four
animals) and the driver may not apply the lash. If the steed is
taken out of action then permanently reduce the speed by the
previous amount until the driver can cut the animal free on
the roll of a 5+. If the last steed is stunned, knocked down or
taken out of action then the wagon comes to a halt and cannot
move unless the steed recovers – make an Out of Control roll
with +2 to the result.

Out of Control
D6 Result
1-3 Swerve – The driver temporarily loses control and the
wagon veers wildly off course. Roll a D6:
1-3 – Swerves 45 degrees to the left.
4-6 – Swerves 45 degrees to the right.
The wagon then moves another 6" in the predetermined
direction.
4-5 Runaway – The steeds bolt and the driver loses control of
them. Each turn randomly determine the direction that the
wagon goes in. Roll a D6:
1-2 – Swerves 45 degrees to the left.
3-4 – Swerves 45 degrees to the right.
5-6 – moves straight ahead.
The wagon will always move at full speed and roll for
applying the lash discounting the effects of a 1 all the time it
is a runaway. Each turn the driver may attempt to take
control of the steeds. The driver must pass a Leadership test
to regain control of the beasts. The crew may not fire missile
weapons all the time the wagon is a runaway as they are
trying to hold on for dear life.
6 Loss of control – The wagon goes wildly out of control.
Roll a D6:
1 – The wagon swerves to the right (see above).
2 – The wagon swerves to the left (see above).
3-4 – The wagon comes to an immediate halt.
5 – The wagon’s yoke pole snaps and the draft animals
gallop off. The vehicle moves 6" straight ahead and then
comes to a halt. The vehicle may no longer move.
6 – The wagon either jack-knifes or hits a rock or a
depression in the road and goes into a roll! The wagon
moves D6" in a random direction determined by the
Artillery Scatter dice. Any warriors/beasts it collides with
take the usual collision damage. All the crew and draft
animals take D3 Strength 4 hits. The wagon is now wrecked.
Wagon Location
D6 Result
1-2 Draft creature – Roll to wound and injure as normal – see
loss of draft creature below for effects.
3 Crew– Randomly select a crew member and roll to wound
and injure as normal – see Loss of Driver overleaf if
applicable. Any crew member that is wounded must make
an immediate Initiative test – if this is failed he has fallen
from the wagon and must test for falling damage.
4-5 Chassis – Roll to damage the vehicle using the stat line
below.
6 Wheel – Roll to damage the wheel using the stat-line below.
Wheel Damage
D6 Result
1-4 Wheel damaged – The wagon’s speed is permanently reduced
by -2".
5-6 Wheel flies off! – The wagon immediately swerves (see the
swerve result on the Out of Control table above) and then comes to a
halt. The wagon is now immobile. Roll a D6, on the score of 5-6 the
wagon goes into a roll (see the roll result on the Out of Control table
above).

Wheel Damage: If a wheel is damaged this is potentially
disastrous. Randomly determine which wheel has been
damaged and roll on the table above adding +1 to the result if
the wheel has been damaged before.
Chassis Damage: When the wagon loses its final point of
damage/wound it is destroyed, comes to an immediate halt
and each crew member/draft animal must make an Injury roll.
Combat
Warriors may strike a stationary wagon in close combat by
charging and striking against the part they are in contact with
(draft creatures / crew / wheel / chassis).
Chassis/wheels: Attacks hit automatically – just resolve
damage.
Crew: Crew on board a stationary wagon are counted as
defending an obstacle and a 6 is required to hit them
regardless of Weapon Skill. If a crew member is taken out of
action an attacker may enter/board the wagon in his next turn.
Draft Animals: The draft animals may be attacked in the
usual manner although an attacker may choose to cut the
draft animals free instead which requires a 2+ on a D6 to be
successful. Draft animals that are cut free count as un-led
beasts (see above).

Warriors may attempt to attack a moving wagon by charging
it in the normal way. Note: Charging a moving wagon does
not bring it to a halt – the combat round is played out and
then the wagon is free to move in its next Movement phase –
if it is a runaway then it is compelled to move. Warriors are
advised to attack to the side and rear because if they attack to
the front they are liable to be run down in the wagon’s next
turn! Because attacking a moving wagon is a haphazard affair
the attacker must determine the location struck first by rolling
on the Location table above. Both the chassis and wheels are
hit automatically just resolve damage. The draft animals are
attacked in the normal manner although an attacker may not
attempt to cut the reins on moving draft animals. The crew
are difficult to strike and therefore a 6 is require to hit them
regardless of Weapon Skill.
If the attackers manage to successfully board the wagon
either when it was stationary or by leaping aboard it as it was
moving they may engage the crew in combat in the usual
manner without any penalties or modifiers. Note: Attackers
or defenders that are injured fighting aboard a wagon must
pass an Initiative test or fall off.
##### Boats

This covers small rowing boats through to large river barges.
Note that these are very basic rules to cover small skirmishes
on the rivers of the Empire, a more inclusive set of rules to
cover ocean-going ships is currently in development.
Movement
Boats move 6" when moving with the current of a river (the
direction of the river flow must be established before the start
of the game). Boats may move 4" when travelling against the
current. Boats must move at least half of their movement
allowance unless they have been anchored or tethered to the
shore.
Turns
Boats, regardless of size, may make a single turn of up to 45
degrees at the end of their movement.
Terrain
A boat can encounter natural terrain such as rocks or
manmade obstacles such as logjams specifically placed to
obstruct its movement. Both the aforementioned terrain types
are impassable to boats and they will suffer D3 Strength 7
hits should they move into them and also come to an
immediate halt.
Collision
If a boat collides with another boat both suffer D3 Strength 7
hits (roll location and damage as normal below). In the case
that either attackers or defenders block the way of a boat and
it cannot move around them then the boat will move through
the models, even if they are from the defending warband. All
of the models touched by a boat that is forced to move
through them must roll lower or equal to their Initiative or
suffer a S4 hit with all of the consequences. Warriors that are
out of action cannot get out of the way of a wagon and are
therefore automatically hit. Whenever a boat collides with
anything roll a D6, on a score of a 1 make an Out of Control
test.

Transport
All the above rules for wagons apply. In addition, because
boats are considerably bigger than wagons, they can therefore
transport a lot more.
A rowboat can transport up to six human-sized warriors or
smaller, or the equivalent in cargo.
A river boat can transport up to eight human-sized warriors
or smaller, or the equivalent in cargo.
A barge can transport up to twelve human-sized warriors or
smaller, or the equivalent in cargo.
Mounting/Dismounting
See above for wagons, except warriors that fail an Initiative
test for attempting to board a moving boat do not suffer
damage but fall into the water – see the rules for swimming.
Shooting
Shooting from a wagon: Crew may fire from aboard a boat
and have a 360 degree arc of fire. Shooters suffer a penalty of
-1 to hit for firing from a moving surface.
Shooting at a wagon: Warriors may shoot at a vehicle and
gain a +1 to hit because it is a large target. If a hit is scored
against a boat then a roll must be made on the Location table
opposite to decide what part of the vehicle has been hit.

after coming to a complete halt by using a combination of
oars/boat-hooks.
3-4 Crew – Randomly select a crew member and roll to wound
and injure as normal – see loss of driver above if applicable.
Any crew member that is wounded must make an immediate
Initiative test – if this is failed he has fallen from the boat.
5-6 Hull – Roll to damage the boat using the stat-line above.

Propulsion Damage
Propulsion Damage: Either the oars or the mast and rigging
have been damaged. Roll a D6 and consult the table.
D6 Result
1-2 Sail damaged/oars splintered – The boat’s speed is
permanently reduced by -1".
4-5 Rigging damaged/oars splintered – The boat’s speed is
permanently reduced by -2".
6 Mast falls! – With the loss of the mast (or all of the oars in
the case of an oared vessel) the boat may only drift 2" in the
direction of the current. All crew must immediately test on
their Initiative to avoid the falling mast (this does not apply
to oared vessels obviously). If a crewman fails this test he
receives an immediate Strength 6 hit.
Hull Damage: When the boat loses its final point of
damage/wound it is destroyed and sinks immediately. Each
crew member falls into the water and must make the
appropriate tests for swimming.
Combat
See wagons above. Note: Swimming warriors may not attack
boats!

#### Blackpowder weapons

During the period in which Mordheim is set, the technology
needed to make blackpowder weapons was still rare, and
pistols, handguns, blunderbusses, etc were prone to
malfunctions, jams and misfires.
The following rules were not included in the Shooting
section, as they would have slowed down the game, but if
you want to create more realistic games, feel free to use the
Misfire rules below.
If you do use these rules, you might want to reduce the cost
of the weapons (we suggest by 20%) to keep the balance of
the game fair.

##### Misfires

Each time you roll a 1 when rolling to hit with a blackpowder
weapon (handgun, pistol, blunderbuss, warplock pistol, etc),
roll a D6 and consult the chart below.

##### Blackpowder Weapons Misfires

1 BOOM! The weapon explodes with a deafening roar! The
shooter suffers an S4 hit (this does not cause critical hits)
and the weapon is destroyed.
2 Jammed. The weapon is jammed and useless for the
remainder of the battle. You may use it as normal in the
next battle.
3 Phut. The weapon fails to fire and you must remove the
shot. This means that the shooter must wait one extra turn
before he can fire this weapon again.
4-5 Click. The weapon fails to fire, but there is no additional
effect.
6 KA-BOOM! The weapon roars and spits a cloud of black
smoke and flame! The shot hits the intended target and
counts as having +1 Strength.
#### Fighting individual battles

One thing we discovered during play testing Mordheim was
that after a while very experienced warbands became
virtually unbeatable when fighting against novice warbands.
Whilst this might be amusing for the player with the
experienced warband, it will result in a very one-sided
battle, where the inexperienced warband is swiftly crushed,
without even a chance to put up a decent fight. Although the
underdogs system balances this out somewhat, it is often
much more fun to play with roughly equal forces, especially
when introducing new players to the game.
The following rules allow both players to pick warbands up
to an agreed equal value, say 1,000 gold crowns. This will
make the game much more even, as the two forces will be
roughly similar in strength. Use the Warband lists to recruit
and equip your warband. The lists tell you which Heroes,
Henchmen and equipment your warband is allowed to use.
The limitations of the list ensure that the warbands are
reasonably balanced.
You must recruit at least three warriors, including a leader,
and you may either follow the limitations for the maximum
size of a warband given in the list or agree a maximum size
with your opponent.

##### Weapons & armor

Each Hero you recruit may be armed with one or more
weapons and any armor chosen from the appropriate list.
Different types of Hero are restricted to different types of
weapon. The Equipment lists for the individual warbands tell
you exactly what equipment is available. You may buy rare
weapons and armor. Pay the appropriate prices for these as
given in the Trading charts.
Every model in each Henchman group must take exactly the
same weapons and armor. This means that if your
Henchman group has four warriors, and you want to buy
them swords, you must buy four swords.

The weapons you choose for your warriors must be
represented on the models. This way your opponent will
know what he is facing (and he will not be shocked to
discover in the middle of the game that the warrior who looks
like a Halfling with a bow is in fact an Ogre with a club!).
The exceptions to this rule are knives and daggers, which you
may assume are tucked in boots or concealed in their clothes,
if not actually represented on the model.
##### Upgrading heroes

In a campaign game, you must earn statistic increases, but in
one-off games they can be bought beforehand. You may
increase the starting characteristics of your Heroes by paying
the cost in gold crowns given below.
Note that all races have maximum statistics values. These can
be found in the Experience section of this rulebook.
Movement +15gc per point.
Weapon Skill +15gc per point.
Ballistic Skill +15gc per point.
Strength +25gc for the first increase/+35gc for each
additional increase.
Toughness +30gc for the first increase/+45gcfor each
additional increase.
Wounds +20gc for the first increase/+30gc for each
additional increase.
Initiative +10gc per point.
Attacks +25 GC for the first increase/+35gc for
each additional increase.
Leadership +15gc per point.
Skills +40gc for each skill. You may choose one
skill at this price for each characteristic
increase you take. Choose from the skills
normally available to your warrior.
##### Ready for battle

The warband is now ready to fight against your opponent.

#### Night Fights

By Donato Ranzato & Chris Van Tighem
The night surrounded them like a blanket of darkness, and
Yarri felt like he was wading in an sea of black. The nights at
Mordheim are bitterly cold, and so dark the darkness seems
to suck in and engulf all light. The monsters too, seem to
favour the night, and the unexpected happens more than any
warband leader would like.
Yarri sat hushed next to his old friend, his handgun cocked
and ready to blow away towards any sound he heard. He
jumped as a hand touched his shoulder, but soon he calmed
his mind thinking it was only Grum trying to gather his
bearings. However, his calm nerves lasted only a second
longer as the grip tightend and long claws dug into his
shoulder.
Yarri cried out for help, but all he received was a strangled
cry emanating from the darkness and a brutal blow the
head...

##### Summary of rules:

All missile weapons firing at short range are at -1 to hit, and
at long range -2 to hit.
All psychology tests (Fear, All Alone, etc,) are taken with a -
1 modifier to Ld. This represents the increased unease of
combatants in the dark.
Fighters with all types of bows have the option of using
Flaming arrows which they may search for and purchase
prior to the game beginning instead of after the fight.
However some restrictions do apply. The model moves at -1
to its movement since braziers have to be carried in order to
light the arrows. All attacks from flaming arrows count as
flammable attacks and will cause double wounds on
flammable creatures.

Creatures immune to psychology will be unaffected by
darkness modifiers for psychology tests and will not flee
faster. They simply shrug off the eerie effects of the darkness.
The night is the time for wild and powerful magic. All
spellcasters (except for those who uses prayers) benefit from
a +1 to casting for the duration of battle. However, if a
Wizard rolls doubles while casting they must immediately
roll a D6. If the result of the roll is 1 the model is
immediately taken out of action, if a 2 or 3 is rolled than the
wizard has lost the ability to cast for the remainder of the
battle and a roll of 4-6 no ill effects occur.
A cavalry charges causes fear representing the visual and
psychological impact of a cavalry charge from out of the
gloom. However, if a one is rolled on the attack than the
mounted figure must make an initiative check or be thrown
from their mount (the mount had unsteady footing). The
falling warrior takes a d3 Str.2 wounds and the mount,
spooked by the fall will run off 3d6 inches away from the
combat.
While no creature can see in the dark there are a few that
have adapted to life in darkenss. Through their use of smell,
touch or some supernatural ability they tend to have an easier
time after the sun sets than most. Any Skaven, Dwarf,
Undead, or Beastmen may, once per turn reroll any result
once. The second roll stands and if a one is rolled on the
reroll than that warrior loses the benefit of the reroll for the
remainder of the game.
Note: If you are using the optional rule of random events -
they now occur on a 1 or 2, instead of just 1.
#### The Catacombs

By Donato Ranzato
"I would not look at the marching things. That I desperately resolved as I heard their cracking joints and nitrous wheezing
above the dead music and the dread tramping. It was merciful that they did not speak... but by Sigmar! Their crazy torches
began to cast shadows on the surface of those stupendous columns. Foulness should not have human hands and carry
torches... living creatures should not have the heads of sheer insanity..." - Last page of the diary of Magnus Faustlich, also
known as Magnus the Fearless
What most people in Mordheim don't know, is that far below
the sewers there are tunnels that were old even before
Mordheim existed. They were there before Sigmar was born,
and they could even be there before the Slann arrived. The
Skaven have known of these ancient subterranean tunnels for
years as they have found openings to these deeper regions
during their excavations of the sewers below the city. And
what they found there scared them more then the cursed city
above them. They know that there is something truly evil
waiting in these primordial catacombs. Something older then
the earth, maybe even older then the universe. And the
meteor woke it up...

##### Exploring the Catacombs

Far below the earth the silence is ceaseless and oppressive. A
terrible impression of the huge weight of suspended stone and
earth is forced upon anyone who enters. Occasional gusts of
wind pass down the main tunnel, causing candles and torches
to gutter momentarily. There is no light, except for an
occasional glow from livid purple or putrid green fungi -
slimy stuff disgusting to touch. Side tunnels and tiny votary

alcoves frequently open to either side. Along the main tunnel,
loathsome images panel the walls, depicting men with the
heads of animals, animals with human limbs, and alien
entities performing cruel, disgusting, and obscene rituals.
Some parts of these black passages are obviously cut from
the stone; other parts look like old watercourses or rock
fractures; other parts look as if acids had eaten through the
stone; still other parts have obviously been hacked clear by
alien tooth and claw.
It looks like the tunnels go in a straight line, and it is true that
their direction is consistent, but the angles of the walls, floor,
and ceiling constantly change, and the passages themselves
may narrow as little as two feet across, or be as much as 15
feet wide by 15 feet high. More strikingly, the ways
constantly rise and fall; it is impossible to see very far ahead
or very far behind. Even the glow of torches will not carry
far. These tunnels have an organic feel, and leave the
perception that some great alien beast had been imprisoned
within the stone, had then gotten free, and the fighters now
creep along the spaces left by its bones and sinews.

##### Rules

This is not a separate scenario but more of a set of rules to be
used by the moderator when he wants to situate a scenario in
the catacombs deep below Mordheim. The moderator could
read aloud the above section describing the tunnels the
warbands walk in to give the players a general impression of
their surroundings. Its up to the individual moderator how he
likes to represent these ancient catacombs on his table. It is
advised to use separate tiles or board sections to represent the
more narrow parts of the tunnels. Most fighting between the
warbands will probably be fought out in the larger and wider
parts of the catacombs. Both players should place their
warbands in a marching order, no more then two models
wide. This marching order represents the warbands exploring
the narrow tunnels.
Fighters exploring the catacombs must make a Fear Test
every other turn. If failed then that fighter won't walk any
further until he succeeds again on his Fear test. He may test
every turn to see if he will walk further down these ancient
tunnels.
Because the lines of sight will vary, if the warband include
toters of ranged magickal or physical attacks, moderators
should continue to monitor the march order of the warband to
ascertain if those weapons or spells can be brought to bear.

##### Encounters beneath the City

Not all of these encounters have an immediate effect on a
scenario. Some of the encounters are just to try to scare the
players and to give them a feeling for the atmosphere below
the city. The moderator should roll once in each of the
players Movement phases, before that player has moved.
3D6 EVENT
3 No encounter; warband proceed without incident.
4 A random fighter stumbles and falls; slimy luminous moss
coats his hands, elbows, and knees, which he is unable to
rub off. Because the fighter is now illuminated all hits
against him are at +1.
5 One of the fighters hear snatches of conversation; two men
are saying that intruders may be in the tunnels. The voices
cannot be located.
6 Random fighter slips and falls. That fighter suffers a S3
hit.
7 Warm liquid drips steadily from the tunnel ceiling; the
stone beneath is slick and red; the blood has no source.
8 A foul stench engulfs the warband; each fighter must take
a Toughness test on 1D6 or the fighter is at -1S for D3
turns.
9 Some shapeless thing is glimsed; but it leaves neither trace
nor track of its passage.
10 Macabre chuckles, growls, or groans are heard in the
blackness; maybe a single sound, maybe a hideous
cacaphony of noise erupts without reason.
11 A violent blast of wind extinguishes all unshielded candles
and torches. The warband is now in complete and utter
darkness. A fighter may try to re-lite a torche once a turn
by rolling below his Initiative on 1D6.
12 A small rock falls from the ceiling and strikes a random
fighter; the fighter suffers a S4 hit on the head and if
wounded is automatically Stunned unless he wears a
helmet, in that case the fighter counts as being Knocked
Down.
13 The floor of the tunnel is seen to be bordered by jet-black
roses.
14 Cave-in rains rocks on the warband. Each fighter must
make a Initiative test or suffer D3 S4 hits.
15 Narrow, deep pit; leading fighter must make an Initiative
test to avoid the slippery edge. If the roll fails roll a 2D6 to
determine depth of pit. The fighter suffers D3 hits of
Strenght equal to the depth of the pit.
16 1D6+4 Tunnel dwellers appear. Roll one die; odd result
indicates Tunnel dwellers come from the rear, even result
indicates the Tunnel dwellers come from the front. See
below for Tunnel dwellers rules.
17 Random fighter must make a Fear test. If he fails he
perceives that, in every direction, the brick walls of the
tunnel are rhythmically moving in and out, like breathing
lungs. The fighter must flee 2D6" back in the direction he
came from.
18 The warband stumbles upon the lair of the Ancient One.
Luckily it is not paying attention to these puny creatures.
Because of the sanity-blasting image of this Elder Being
all of the members of the warband must make a Fear test
with a –2 modifier. If more then three members succeed,
the warband can get away with 3D6 Gold Crowns and one
random Magic Item.

#### Sewer Fighting

By Christian Ellegaard, Thanks to the guys on the Egroups Mailing List who have come up with ideas and suggestions for
Sewer Fighting rules
As every good big city in the Empire, Mordheim has its own
sewer that helps the city staying clean. Being a big, complex
system of corridors, water pipes and gutters to lead the water,
all the waste of the inner as well as the outer parts of the city
are lead through these channels to the mighty river Stir, that
flows through Mordheim. Once in a while it happens that the
ground collapses above a sewer tunnel and creates an
entrance to the lower parts of the ruins, and many a warband
has explored these dungeons.
In addition, some of the most cold-blooded and fearless
warriors tend to establish their lair in the sub-urban terrain,
enjoying the humid, ill-smelling climate and the many
different mutated beasts that provide their food when
everything else fails. Sometimes it even happens that two
warbands clash with each other underground, and often they
will get into fight believing that the enemy is in possession of
Wyrdstone, gold, treasures or whatever. Sewer fighting is
quite different from fighting under the stars. Warriors tend to
panic much easier - even the slightest dripping of water or a
harmless bat crossing the corridor may scare a warrior, and
knowing that the enemy is nearby does not make things any
better.
Therefore, when fighting underground, use the following
rules:

##### Sewers

The sewer corridors can be represented by the standard
Warhammer Quest floorplans, but since these may be a bit
small for Warhammer Skirmish games it may be necessary to
make your own terrain or use any appropriate items for
creating a sewer-like scenery.
Later in this article I shall come up with a suggestion of how
you easily and quickly can make your own sewer terrain.

##### Darkness

Despite all warriors usually bring torches with them in the
sewers and even a few Heroes might have some lanterns, the
sewers are still darker than the night. Therefore, warriors in
the sewers have a limited range of vision which makes
shooting much harder.
Before the game, each warrior in each warband must be given
a special sewer Line of Sight. Roll a D6 for the warrior and
add an additional D6 for each full 2 Initiative the warrior has.
The result is the number of inches that the warrior can see!
Skaven, Dwarves, Vampires, Ghouls and the Possessed, who
are all used to the dark conditions, may roll 2D6 + D6 for
each full 2 Initiative points they have rather than only D6. In
addition, Skaven may automatically re-roll any results they
do not find satisfying, but they must accept the latter result
regardless if it is worse.
Dogs, feeling the terror that lurks in the sewers, will never
enter the sewers. Warbands with any kind of dogs must
therefore leave their pets outside!
To make things easier, however, henchman groups are
allocated a single Line of Sight instead of an individual
number for each warrior. Use the highest Initiative of the
group, representing the most agile and aware warrior warning

his comrades or pointing out special spots that they should try
to hit.
A warrior can shoot no longer than his maximum Line of
Sight, and neither can he run any longer since that would
mean he might run into some walls or other unexpected
obstacles. Use the standard Short and Long ranges when
shooting as described in the Mordheim rulebook.
You can use small cardboard counters or dice to remember
the Line of Sight of the different warriors.
##### Lanterns

Lanterns are very useful when fighting in sewers. Therefore,
when playing sewer scenarios lanterns are bought at 10 Gold
Crowns' cost rather than the standard cost, and only Heroes
may carry them. Use the standard rules for lanterns even in
the sewers.
However, lanterns do not only make it easier for the user to
see, but it also makes it much harder for the enemy to spot
him because he is getting blinded by the bright light of the
lantern. Any opponents that wish to shoot with missile
weapons against a warrior with a lantern may ignore his
standard Line of Sight because they are, after all, easier to
spot in the darkness, but they will always, regardless the
distance, hit on a D6 roll of 6.
A Hero or a Henchman group with a lantern may re-roll if
they fail the Leadership test to see if they may move, as
described below.
##### Psychology

As already mentioned, the dark, smelly, plague-infested and
horrible sewers of Mordheim can really scare a mortal man or
beast to death, especially in a cut-throat fight against a deadly
opponent.
Therefore, all warbands, except Skaven who actually live
there and the Undead that really has no fear, are subject to the
following rules:
Before each turn, each Henchman group must take a
Leadership test based on their standard Leadership value
without penalties. If they fail, then something has scared
them - probably nothing else than their own shadow on the
walls or a silly little rat scuttling over the muddy and dirty
floor. The Henchmen may do nothing this turn, and if they
are in close combat then they are only allowed to defend and
parry any opposing attacks.
If they succeed the test, then they may move as normal.
If the group has a Hero with them, then they may re-roll one
of the failed dice representing the Hero talking encouraging
to them.
All warriors in a warband get a -1 Leadership penalty for
fighting in scary surroundings. Warriors are more likely to
turn around and flee than in daylight, and at any ordinary
Psychology tests they use their standard Leadership value -1.
Note, however, that this does not apply when rolling for
Leadership before a Henchman may move.

##### Dirty slimy floor

Many of the major tunnels in a sewer are used for leading the
worst dirt, faces and waste away from the city while other
rooms are simply used for containing waste. Often it can be
difficult to see if it is possible to trespass the floor, and
therefore it sometimes appears that warriors jump into deep
holes that are filled with old refuse.
Generally there are 4 different kinds of floors:
Muddy but clear: Old waste is laying here and there,
although not in thick layers. The floor is rather clear, and it is
possible to enter the floor and move as normal.
Water: The floor is lowered so that it can lead water through
the sewer, and the water reaches a normal man to his waist.
That means that the warrior can choose to swim rather than
walk through the water! In the beginning of any turn a
warrior in water may swim. A warrior may swim no more
than his total Movement rate. When a warrior is swimming it
is impossible to hit him with any missile weapon. It is
impossible to run through water despite warriors may walk
normally.
Deep sludge: The floor is covered by a thick layer of sludge
and waste, and it makes it harder to move through. A warrior
crossing a sludgy floor gets a -1 Movement penalty and
becomes unable to run. In addition, enemies shooting at a
warrior wading through deep sludge will suffer a -1 To Hit
penalty because the sewage might take some of the shots that
are directed against the warrior. If the warrior is engaged in
Close Combat he will suffer a -1 To Hit penalty too because
fighting in deep dirt is indeed harder than fighting on normal
ground.
Messy slippery floor: The floor is very slippery, and the
warriors tend to trip over especially when running across the
section. Each time a warrior walks over or moves from a
merry slippery floor, roll a D6: On a result of 1 the warrior
trips over and is knocked down. If the warrior is running,
then he will fall over on a D6 roll of 1-3!
You can either decide before the battle which type of floor
the different sewer sections contain which is especially
appropriate when fighting over your own, modeled terrain
where you can represent the sludge, water or whatever on the
floorplans, or you can decide it randomly while the battle is
on. If you choose the latter option, roll 2D6 every time a
warrior enters a new sewer section:
Random floor table
2D6 Result
2-5 Deep sludge
6-8 Muddy but clear
9-10 Water
11-12 Messy slippery floor

##### Rotten planks

In many a sewer channel, wooden sidewalks have been built
so that the sewer workers could easier pass through the
tunnels. However, the bad climate in the sewers have meant
that the wooden planks have rot, and here and there they are
broken too.
A warrior who wishes to run over a wooden bridge, sidewalk
etc. or jump down on it must first pass an Initiative test,
subtracting 1 from the die (natural 6's always fail). If the
warrior fails he has crashed through the bridge and will fall
down as described below.
Place a special Crashed Planks counter (no, you can't find it
in the boxed set - you got to make your own!) on the spot
where the warrior's movement ended. Other warriors that
might wish to cross a Crashed Planks counter must jump!
Skaven, being very used to the tunnels, know exactly where
to place their paws on the walkways without falling through.
Therefore, Skaven automatically pass this Initiative test and
may run freely over wooden walkways and bridges.
##### Face down in the sludge

Sometimes it happens that warriors fall down in the sewage
or become knocked down in a close combat. This is very
uncomfortable indeed!
A warrior falling into the sewage from a higher point will get
plunged into the slimy muddy sludge, and this is hard to
escape! Measure the distance the warrior fell in inches, the
distance being the number of turns the warrior will be in the
sewage. However, no damage is done when hitting the
sewage unlike falling down on a normal ground.
If the warrior is wearing Heavy Armor then there is no
mercy: The heavy metal plates are dragging the warrior
down, and being unable to cut off the straps he will slowly
suffocate... Tip: Do not run with warriors that are wearing
Heavy Armor!
In close combat it is also quite hard getting up again if being
knocked down. Therefore, when a warrior wishes to get up
after having being knocked down or stunned he must pass an
Initiative test on a D6. Otherwise he will remain knocked
down.

#### Fire

By Steve Hart with help from the guys at the Mordheim e-mail list
Mordheim even though now in ruins is still plagued with
fires. Now left alone these fires can spread quickly through
the ruins. These fires have many causes and on occasions
warbands have been known to get caught in the midst of a
raging fire while fighting.

##### When and Where

These fire rules are not for any specific scenario. The use of
these rules is to add a bit more chaos to the battles that rage
across the city. They can be added to any game as long as
both players agree.

##### Starting

Before the game starts but after the terrain has been set up
randomly choose one building to be on fire. Mark this
building with a counter or plumes of smoke or any other way
that you can think of.
NOTE: If you are playing a scenario that focuses on a
specific building (like defend the find) then the objective
building cannot start the game on fire.

##### It spreads!

As the buildings burn, their flames can jump to other building
quickly setting them ablaze. At the end of each players turn
roll a dice for each building that is on fire and consult the
chart below:
1 GOES OUT: The fire has exhausted all the flammable
materials in the building and goes out as quickly as it
appeared.
2 - 3 KEEPS BURNING: The flames continue the ravage the
building but do not spread this turn.
5 - 6 SPREADS: The fire spreads to the nearest (non-burning)
building within 10"
Roads cannot set on fire due to the lack of substantial burning
items. If however you have a road that is covered in
flammable object you can count this as the nearest building.

##### Entering buildings on fire

Entering a building that is surrounded in flame is a risky
option but some will dare to venture into the flames.
You must declare that a model is entering a building on fire
before he/she does so. The model must now make a
leadership test to overcome the fear of entering the building.
If they pass this test they may enter the building. If the model
fails then that model will not enter the building and cannot
move for the rest of the turn.

##### Moving inside

Models inside the building have to constantly dodge flames
and falling timber (like in the action films), and one mistake
can stop even a hero in his tracks.

Models wishing to move while inside an ablaze building
must pass an initiative test to do so, otherwise they cannot
move (blocked by falling timber, flames etc.).
##### Climbing

Models may never climb the wall of building that are
burning.
##### Damage

Funnily enough running around inside a building that is
currently on fire is not good for ones health! At the end of
each turn all models inside buildings that are ablaze must roll
under their toughness on a D6.
If a models rolls equal to his toughness then the smoke from
the flames fill their lungs and prevents them from breathing
for a turn. The model instantly becomes stunned.
If the roll is over the models toughness statistic then the
model instantly suffers D3 strength 3 hits that ignore all
armor saves except magical ones.
##### Frenzy

The more unhinged inhabitants of Mordheim are less likely to
care for the fact that the building they are entering is on fire
(or they just don’t notice)
Models that are subject to the frenzy rules are unaffected by
the rules for entering and moving around inside buildings that
are burning (they just don't care), but they still have to make
a test on their toughness at the end of their turn.
##### Starting Fires

Models cannot start fire unless stated in their rules or by
equipment that they are carrying.
##### Shooting

The roaring flames block most site into the buildings and the
heat distorts the air around it causing it impossible to aim.
You cannot shoot out of or into a building that is on fire.
Neither may you shot through a building on fire.
##### Combat

Sometimes the fire will spread to buildings where opponents
are fighting in hand to hand combat. Event though very
dramatic the fighters are put into an even more reason to win
(and then run).
Hand to hand combat within a burning building is unaffected
except that the models must roll at the end of their turn to see
if they take damage from the flames.
To charge another model while you are inside a burning
building you must pass an initiative test. If this test is failed
the model may do nothing in that movement phase. To charge
from outside you must make a leadership test. Failing this
test will also result in being able to do nothing in that
movement phase.

#### Random Happenings

Mordheim is a dark and sinister city – dangers lurk around every corner. Even the basic laws of nature cannot be relied upon.
Mark Havener and Tim Huckelbery explain how these dangers can be introduced to your battles.
These rules represent the weird and wonderful things that can
happen in Mordheim which are beyond the control of players.
These rules are intended to be optional and should only be
used if agreed on by all players taking part. To determine if a
random encounter occurs, roll a D6 at the start of each
player’s turn. A result of 1 indicates a random encounter.
Roll a D66 for the random encounter on the chart opposite to
see what exactly is encountered and follow the directions.
The player whose turn it is places any models that represent
the encounter and they will act in each of his turns (that
player doesn’t control their actions though, see the individual
descriptions to see how the models act). This player is known
as the ‘Encountering Player’, even though random encounters
will frequently affect only his opponent or both players
indiscriminately. The models that represent a random
encounter must all be placed within 6" of a randomly
determined board edge and they will remain within 2" of
another member of their group at all times. Random

encounter members must be placed (and will remain, unless
their description indicates otherwise) at ground level in the
open. The Encountering Player places the models
representing the random encounter, but note that they cannot
initially be placed within 12" of any warband models.
After being placed, many encounters will travel as quickly as
possible (without running) towards the nearest warband
model. For this purpose the nearest model is the model that
the encounter can reach most quickly and encounter models
will never climb the sides of a building to get at a warband
member. What each encounter does from there is listed in its
description. Note that charging models will engage as many
warband members as they can reach, ganging up if some of
them can’t reach different models. No more than one random
encounter will ever take place in a single game, so after a
random encounter is rolled, the players no longer need to roll
at the start of their turns. Several of the entries below refer to
game turns, this includes both players’ turns.
###### Random Encounters Chart

Roll D66
11 Ogre Mercenary
An Ogre Mercenary (see the Hired Swords section of the Mordheim
rules for details on the Ogre Mercenary) appears further down the
street. Sensing trouble brewing, he decides to seize the opportunity
and offer his services to the warband with the lowest warband rating
(if there are two warbands with the same rating, roll a dice to see
whom he offers his help to). The warband that he offers to help must
add the Hired Sword to its roster for this game. At the end of the
game, the Ogre demands payment for services rendered. The
warband that he joined must pay his hire and upkeep fee. If the
warband cannot (or will not) pay him, he leaves, but not before
taking out his frustration on a random member of the warband (only
roll among members of the warband who were not taken out of
action during the game). Roll for injuries to this unfortunate
member just as if he had been taken out of action.
12 Swarm of Rats
Something in the sewers has frightened the rats that live there. The
rats are in a hurry to get away and will attack anything that stands in
their way. Use a template 80mm x 120mm to represent the rats. Six
monster bases (use rat swarms if you have them), placed in a
rectangle with one short side representing the front, will do nicely.
The rats move 2D6" each turn. They will always move forward
down the centre of the street and if they come to an intersection roll
randomly to determine which direction they take (example: for a
normal four-way cross-intersection roll a D6: 1-2 right, 3-4 straight
forward, 5-6 left). The rats cannot be engaged in close combat and if
they make contact with a model they will run right over him. Any
model moved over by the rats will suffer D3 Strength 2 hits, normal
armor saves apply.
13 Earthquake
Powerful magical energies from the crater at the centre of the city
shake the local landscape. The ground heaves and buckles violently
and warband members find it hard to keep their footing. Roll a D3 to
determine how many game turns the earthquake lasts. While the
shaking persists, all movement is halved, all Initiative tests
(climbing, etc) suffer a -2 penalty and all Shooting and Close
Combat to hit rolls are made with a -1 penalty.
14 High Winds

A powerful wind screams through the area, wildly scattering debris
and knocking down anything that is not firmly anchored to the
ground. Warband members now suffer a -1 penalty to all Initiative
tests (climbing, jumping, etc) and to hit rolls (close combat and
shooting) for the rest of the game.
15 Blood for the Blood God!
Unfortunately for the warbands involved, the scent of blood has
brought the attention of one of Khorne’s minions. Reality is
breached as a vicious Bloodletter emerges from the Realm of Chaos
to shed even more blood for its master. The Bloodletter has the
following characteristics in the Beast, Monsters & townsfolk section
Special Rule: The Bloodletter will stay for D6 turns after which it
will disappear.
16 Lucky Find
One random model, on his feet and not in hand-to-hand combat or
fleeing, has stumbled upon a shard of wyrdstone! Assuming he
doesn’t go out of action, this is added to any other shards the
warband finds after the game. If he is taken out of action in close
combat, the enemy model steals the shard away! Note that only non-
animal models can find or steal a shard, not Dire Wolves, Hunting
Dogs, etc.
21 Restless Spirit
Countless unfortunates have suffered agonising deaths in countless
forms since the comet crashed into the city. Not all of these
individuals can easily accept their new condition and they refuse to
rest. Perhaps they left some important task unfinished or seek
revenge on those who did them harm. The warbands have stumbled
upon one such ghost. Any warband member who is within 8" of the
spirit at the start of its Movement phase must make a Leadership test
or flee (exactly as if he were fleeing from combat). Models that are
immune to psychology automatically pass this test. This creature is
unable to affect (or be affected by) the physical world, but it is very
frightening nonetheless. The spirit moves 4" in a random direction,
moving through walls, obstacles or warband members as if they
were not there. It will not charge and cannot be harmed by the
warband members in any way. The only exception to this is if the
spirit comes into contact with a Sigmarite Matriarch or a Warrior-
Priest of Sigmar. These models may choose to put the dead to rest.
If the player controlling such a model decides to do this, the spirit is
Assembled By Paul H Page 305 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


immediately banished (disappears and does not return) and the priest
gains one Experience point.

22 Burning Building
Suddenly, one of the buildings (chosen at random) bursts into
flames, ignited by smouldering embers from a fire thought
extinguished long ago. Any models inside take a S3 hit unless they
move outside in that turn and any models within 2" of the walls take
a S2 hit from the smoke and heat unless they move further away as
well. For the rest of the game, the building itself will cause fear due
to the intense flames and anyone who wishes to enter it must first
pass a Fear test exactly as if they wished to charge a fear-causing
enemy.
23 Man-Eater
One of the trees growing in the area has been changed into a
carnivorous predator by exposure to the Chaos magic inundating the
area. Randomly determine which member of the Encountering
Player’s warband finds the plant. That model is attacked as a large
mouth opens up in the trunk of the tree and its branches whip down
to grab its unfortunate victim. Place a tree next to the victim. He is
now considered to be in close combat with the tree, which has the
following characteristics:
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Tree 0 3 0 4 6 3 3 2 10
The tree automatically passes any Leadership tests it is required to
make. Any result on the Injury table will cause the Man-Eater to
stop attacking, though it is not possible to actually take it out of
action or knock it down. Opponents are +1 to hit the tree, due to the
fact that it is rooted to the spot!
24 Skeletons
While the intense magic of the area rapidly dissolves skeletons to
dust, shambling hordes of them spring up at random from the bones
of the fallen. Uncontrolled, they roam the city wasteland, blindly
attacking everything they find before falling apart.
Use the Profile of the Skeleton in Beasts Monsters & Townsfolk
Section. 2D6 Skeletons appear.
with the following profile:
They are armed with simple weapons or bony fists (treat as daggers
in close combat). The skeletons will move towards and attack the
closest models as quickly as possible. Roll a D3 when they appear,
after that many turns they crumble back to inanimate bones (count
the current turn as the first one).
25 The Twisting of the Air
Reality itself seems to twist, warping perceptions until no one can be
sure of what their senses tell them. Roll a D6 at the start of each
player’s turn. For the next D3 game turns, the distance within which
warriors can use their Leader’s Leadership value and the distance
for being All Alone is the value rolled instead of the normal 6". All
distances between models are also increased by the same D6" roll
for purposes of weapon ranges and charging. Note that the actual
models are not moved, but only the shooting/charging model’s
perception of the distance.

26 Spawn
The warbands have stumbled upon one of the many former
inhabitants of the city that got too close to the crater at the centre of
the city and was turned into a mindless spawn. Spawn have the
following characteristics:
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Spawn 2D6 3 0 4 4 2 3 2D6 10
Fear: Spawn are disgusting and revolting blasphemies against
nature and cause fear.
Psychology: They are mindless creatures, knowing no fear of pain
or death. Spawn automatically pass any Leadership based test they
are required to make.
Movement: The Spawn moves 2D6" towards the nearest model in
each of its Movement phases. It does not double its movement for
charging, instead if its movement takes it into contact with a model
it counts as charging and engages that model in close combat.
Attacks: Roll at the beginning of each Close Combat phase to
determine the spawn’s number of Attacks for that phase.
31 Collapsing Building
Pick one building at random. Any models inside must pass an
Initiative test or suffer a S5 hit, armor saves applying as normal, as
the building collapses. Remove the building from the table
(replacing with ruins if possible), and place the models back on the
table where it stood. Any models climbing the sides of a building or
on the roof when it collapses automatically fall from whatever
height they were at.
32 Scrawling on a Wall
A randomly determined warband member who is within 4" of a
building (if there are no models this close to a building, ignore this
encounter), sees writing suddenly appear in blood on the wall
closest to him. Roll on the following table to find out what the
writing says:
D6 Result
1 The writings are a map of the area. The model’s warband
receives a +1 on the roll to pick the scenario for the next
game they take part in.
2 Reading the writing accidentally sets off a spell on the
reader. The model suffers a minor curse and now has a -1
penalty to all dice rolls for the rest of the game.
3 The warband member learns of the remains of some booty
inside the building. If he moves inside he finds a D6 gold
crowns.
4 The writings reveal all the hiding places in the area. The
model can hide, even in the open, for rest of the game.
5 The warband member learns of a secret passage inside the
building – if he moves inside, he can pop out next turn in
any other building.
6 A fun read, but nothing else happens (Veskit was here!).
33 Thick Fog
A fog rolls in, thick as pea soup. Models can only see 2D6" (roll
once for the distance all models can see; do not roll individually for
each model). Re-roll at start of each Encountering Player’s turn to
see what the visibility is for that turn. The fog lasts for the rest of the
game.
34 Hands of Stone
Hands of earth and stone suddenly jut out of the ground in a small
area of the battlefield. The Encountering Player must pick a spot
anywhere on the battlefield and anything within 3" of that spot is
affected. The area is now very difficult ground as the hands grasp
and attempt to hold anyone passing near them. This encounter lasts
one game turn, at the end of which the hands sink back into the
ground.

35 Dog Pack
Recent events in Mordheim have caused many of the city’s dogs to
suddenly find themselves without homes. Groups of these animals
have turned feral and formed into hunting packs. The warbands have
been discovered by one such (very hungry) pack. The pack consists
of 2D3 wild dogs (use the Hunting Dog stats from the Witch Hunter
warband list). The dogs move as quickly as they can toward the
nearest models, dividing themselves as evenly as they can between
multiple targets if they are available. If members of a dog pack take
a warband member out of action, he will be eaten if not rescued. If
no friendly model comes within 6" of where the model fell by the
end of that warband’s next turn, the fallen member is considered lost
(dog food). If a dog pack fails a Rout test, they leave without taking
their ‘food’ with them, any warband members taken out of action in
the last turn of the game have not been eaten and follow the normal
rules for models taken out of action.
36 Possessed!
One randomly selected member of the Encountering Player’s
warband is suddenly possessed by a minor spirit. This spirit is far
too weak to control the model’s entire body, but is instead limited to
controlling one of his or her limbs (usually an arm). The model
takes an automatic hit at his or her own Strength during each of his
or her Close Combat phases until the possession is over and may do
nothing else. The possession lasts D3 game turns. Note that
Sigmarite Matriarchs and Warrior-Priests are immune to this
possession, as are non-living warband members. If such a warband
member is the object of the spirit’s attention, randomly determine
another warband member to suffer the effect instead.
41 Fountain of Blood
The city itself seems to weep as even more blood is shed on its
streets. For the rest of the game, whenever a model is taken out of
action in close combat, the model that did the deed must take a
Strength test or be knocked down as he is hit by a torrent of blood
pouring from the ground. If there were others involved in the
combat they are not affected, as the steaming liquid seems to be
directed only at those who have called it into being by their
bloodthirsty actions.
42-44 Storm of Chaos
Clouds rapidly gather above the city in an unnatural, sickly yellow-
green mass and warp lightning begins to dance from one cloud to
another. Thunder rocks the air, screaming out in almost intelligible
noises. The clouds themselves seem to take on the shapes of
monstrous creatures and both warbands in the conflict look at each
other with fear on their faces. Roll a D6 to see what the storm
manifestation will bring:
Assembled By Paul H Page 307 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


D6 Result
1 Warp lightning begins to strike the ground in search of a
victim. It will hit the warrior with the best armor save,
attracted to the large amount of metal. That warrior takes a
S5 hit, with no armor save possible. If multiple warriors all
have the highest armor save, randomly determine which is
struck. The warp lightning will strike for D3 turns before
moving on towards another part of the city.
2 Fish suddenly fall out of the sky to pelt the area! All
movement is halved for one turn (due to wet, flapping fish
underfoot), but there is no other effect.
3 Wyrdstone dust has mixed with the water vapour in the area
and produced the strange looking clouds from which a
tainted rain begins to fall. The rain burns flesh and eats into
stone and metal. Each warband member in the open takes a
single S2 hit (normal armor saves apply) every turn the rain
lasts until he gets under cover. The rain lasts D3 turns.
4 A magical mass of lightning forms near the ground,
illuminating the area with an eerie greenish glow. It begins
to move about the area, drawn to magical powers from
which it feeds. Place a counter as per the normal Encounter
rules to represent the mass and each turn move it 2D6"
towards the highest level spell user (the one with the most
spells – each turn roll a D6 if two or more spell users have
the highest number of spells). If there are no magic users in
the game, the mass will move towards the opposite table
edge, doing nothing but blocking line of sight as it moves. If
the model the mass is moving towards casts a spell,
immediately move the counter another D6" towards the
model. If the ball of lightning touches the target model, the
model is frozen in time and cannot do anything. While
frozen, the model cannot be attacked or harmed in any way

- the lightning mass protects its prey! After freezing a
model, the lightning will no longer move but will instead
remain near its victim to feed. The lightning will feed for D3
turns on the magical energy of its victim and then flies back
towards the warp clouds above, freeing the magic user. If
the game ends before the feeding is done, the victim is
immediately released. Victims suffer no long-term ill effects
from their exposure to the lightning.
5 A rumbling is heard from overhead, as thunder erupts from
the strange clouds. The thunderclaps become more intense
and the heavy pulses of air brings warriors to their knees as
if they had been hit by cannonballs of solid air. D6 randomly
selected models are knocked down by the air bursts. If any of
these models are in close combat, all other members of that
melee are knocked down as well.
6 Tendrils of smoke drift down from the clouds, winding
around the heads of members of each warband. Randomly
select one Hero from each warband – these warriors have
been chosen by rival storm gods as their champions. The
chosen models must move towards each other every turn
and get into close combat as quickly as possible. Once in
combat, they will automatically pass all Leadership tests and
will fight until only one remains (the combat will end when
one of the models puts his rival out of action). If a warband
does not have any Heroes left in play when the storm gods
choose their champions, a random Henchman will be chosen
from that warband instead.
45 Pit Fighter
This encounter is identical to the Ogre Mercenary encounter before,
except the Hired Sword encountered is a Pit Fighter, not an Ogre
Mercenary.

46 Plague of Flies
An enormous cloud of flies appears in the sky and swoops down on
the warbands below. All models have an extra -1 to hit penalty when
shooting or fighting in close combat as flies buzz around them and
into open orifices. The flies remain for D3 game turns and then fly
away.
51 Sinkhole
An enormous mouth suddenly opens up under the feet of one
randomly determined warband member. Make an Initiative test for
the model. If the test is failed, the model falls into the pit. If a 1 is
rolled for the test, the model is sucked underground and taken out of
action. Any other failure results in the model catching himself in the
opening, which closes around him. Treat the model as being
knocked down for the rest of the game, though he may not move at
all.
52 The Horror in the House
Randomly select one warrior lurking alone inside a building (if there
are no warband members inside a building, ignore this result and re-
roll on the Random Encounters table). Unfortunately for him, he’s
not as alone as he thought. He hears a slight ripping sound as if the
air itself is being torn apart and something manifests itself behind
him. The warrior must make a Fear test and if he fails, in his next
Movement phase he will run screaming 2D6" from the building
towards the nearest table edge and can do nothing else in that turn. If
he passes the test, the unnatural presence still forces him D6"
outside, but he suffers no other effects. At the start of his subsequent
turn, a fleeing model can try to recover from his ordeal by passing a
Leadership test, but at a -1 penalty. If he does, he stops, but cannot
do anything else that turn other than catch his breath. If he fails, he
again moves 2D6", trying in vain to erase the terrifying images from
his memory. For the rest of the game, the building itself will cause
fear, and anyone who wishes to enter it must first pass a Fear test
exactly as if they wished to charge a fear-causing enemy.
53 Plague Victims
Disease is a common occurrence among the few survivors left in the
ruins of the city. This group of a D6 citizens has contracted a
particularly nasty plague known as Nurgle’s Rot. They move at
normal rate (4") towards the nearest warband members, seeking
their help. If they come into contact with a warband member, they
will not attack, but will instead cling to him as they beseech his aid,
hindering him greatly. A model with Plague Victims in contact with
him acts as if he had just recovered from being knocked down
(moves at half rate, may not charge or run, etc. See the Mordheim
rules for details). If one or more of the Plague Victims is charged,
shot at, or otherwise attacked, these pitiful victims will rout
immediately. At the end of the game, roll a dice for each warband
member in play when the Plague Victims appeared and on a roll of
1, that member has contracted Nurgle’s Rot. Roll again to see what
effect the disease has on that member:
D6 Result
1 Major Symptoms: The plague races through the victim’s
system, producing horrible disfiguring lesions before killing
him. If the model is a Henchman, he dies. If the model is a
Hero, roll D3 times on the Serious Injury table (ignoring
Robbed, Bitter Enmity, Captured and Sold to the Pits
results) to determine the long term effects of the disease.
2-5 Minor Symptoms: The plague takes its toll on the victim as
it takes its course. Without proper bed rest the victim will
die. The warband member must miss the next game as he
recovers.
6 Full Recovery! The victim has an especially hardy
constitution or gets an extremely mild case of the disease.
The victim suffers no ill effects.

54 Last One Standing
The horrors of Mordheim can drive even the strongest mind past the
point of madness. This Sigmarite Matriarch (for stats see the Sisters
of Sigmar section of the Mordheim rules) has seen her entire
warband cut down around her and the experience has proven too
much for. She now seeks revenge and is not particular about who
gets to pay! She is armed with a Sigmarite Hammer and steel whip
and wears heavy armor and a helm. She carries Blessed Water and
a Holy Relic on her person as well. She knows the prayers The
Hammer of Sigmar and Armor of Righteousness (see the Prayers of
Sigmar chart in the Mordheim rules for details). Roll randomly to
determine which she casts on herself each turn. She has the skills
Absolute Faith, Jump Up and Step Aside. The Matriarch will move
as quickly as possible towards the nearest model and engage them in
close combat if able. She will not rout and must be taken out of
action to make her stop. If the Matriarch is taken out of action, leave
her body where it fell, any non-animal warband member may loot
her body by moving into contact with it during their Movement
phase. If this warrior is later taken out of action as well, place a
counter where the warrior fell to represent the Matriarch’s
equipment. This can then be picked up by a different model, as
above.
55 Booby Traps
Some nefarious individuals have trapped the whole area the
warbands are searching. These traps may take the form of spiked
pits, deadfalls, spring-driven spiked boards, etc. When this
encounter is rolled, the Encountering Player must randomly
determine which of his warband members has discovered the first
trap. This unfortunate individual springs a trap immediately. If the
trap is not avoided by passing an Initiative test, the model takes a
Strength 3 hit; armor saves apply as normal. From this point until
the end of the game, each player will roll a D6 at the start of his or
her Movement phase. A roll of 1 means that one member of that
player’s warband has sprung a trap and must make an Initiative test
to avoid it. If the trap is not avoided, the model takes a S3 hit as
above; apply any damage before the model is moved.
56 Catacombs
The ground gives way under one randomly selected warrior and he
falls into the depths of the catacombs below the city. He takes a S3
hit from the fall unless he passes an Initiative test, and lands near the
remains of others who have fallen before him. Assuming he’s not
taken out of action by the fall, he discovers one of the following
after a quick search (roll a D6):
D6 Result
1 A helmet
2 A small pouch containing 2D6 gold crowns
3 A lantern
4 A net
5 A vial of Black Lotus
6 A sword
Unless he has a rope & hook, the warrior is stuck in the catacombs
and cannot rejoin the game. He will count as being out of action for
Rout purposes, but will rejoin his warband after the game with no
other untoward effects. If he does have a rope & hook, he can climb
out D3 turns later, appearing inside a randomly determined building.

61 Forbidden Fruit
Ghostly white flowers suddenly open on a tree in the area and emit a
powerful fragrance. Randomly determine a member of the
Encountering Player’s warband who happens to be standing next to
the tree when it comes to life. Place the tree within 2" of this model.
Any warband members within 8" of the tree must make a
Leadership test at the start of each of their turns or move as quickly
as possible towards the tree. If within 1" of the tree, a spellbound
model will pick and eat one of the swollen, blood-red fruit hanging
from its branches. Any model eating one of the fruit is automatically
taken out of action, as powerful poisons incapacitate him or her. A
non-spellbound warband model may keep another model from
moving toward the tree by moving into base to base contact with
him or her and holding him back. Neither model may do anything
else while the spellbound model attempts to move to the tree and the
restraining model attempts to prevent him from doing so. Both
spellbound and restraining models can react normally if attacked in
close combat and a restraining model can give up his attempts at any
time. This encounter lasts the remainder of the game. Close
inspection of the tree reveals the bones of several animals
overgrown with grass and leaves lying at its base.
62 The Lost
Many view the destruction of Mordheim as a sign that the world is
coming to an end. Groups of these lunatics are often drawn to the
city where they attack anyone they come across, certain that they are
in some way helping to avert this cataclysm. This group of D3
Flagellants (see the Witch Hunter section of the Mordheim rules for
stats and special rules) will move as quickly as possible towards the
nearest warband members and engage them in close combat as soon
as they are able. They are armed with flails.
63 Reflecting Pool
One warrior on the ground (selected at random from the
Encountering Player’s warband) notices a small pool of what looks
to be still water. Reflecting the gloomy sky above, it appears to be
liquid metal or unnaturally deep silvery water, rippling only slightly
with the dank breeze blowing through the city. He can ignore it, or
bend quickly to peer into its depths. If he’s brave enough to gaze
into the murky liquid, roll a D6:
D6 Result
1 The water reflects back nightmare images of his own
demise, filling him with fear for his own safety. For the rest
of the game, no matter how far away he is from friendly
models, he will always count as being all alone in close
combat.
2 The warrior glimpses an image of what is yet to come. For
the rest of the current turn he may re-roll (once!) any
shooting or close combat rolls to hit.
3 A faint image of his personal god appears, be it Sigmar or
even the dread Shadowlord. Filled with courage, the warrior
may ignore any and all Leadership-based tests he is required
to make for the rest of the game.
4 The warrior peers into the depths of his own mind,
unlocking untapped abilities. He can detect any enemy
models hidden that turn, even those not in his normal line of
sight, and passes the information on to the rest of his
compatriots. All enemy models lose their hidden status.
5 A slender arm reaches out from the pool, leaving no ripples
in the smooth liquid, and pale fingers touch the warrior’s
chest. The soft caress causes a faint glow, which spreads
throughout his body. Though it quickly dims away, a strong
feeling of strength and vitality is left behind. The warrior
may ignore the next wounding hit he receives, even if it is a
critical hit.

6 The city chooses to reveal its true visage to the warrior,
unveiling the monstrous intelligence that lurks behind the
facade of simple ruins and rubble. The warrior’s mind is
overwhelmed by the enormity of the impression and he
stumbles away in stark terror. For the rest of the game, all
enemy models count as causing fear to the warrior and he
will refuse to enter any buildings or get within 2" of any
walls or ruins. After the game the effects will wear off,
though he will always hesitate slightly before entering an
unlit room from now on...
Note: Only warriors who can gain in experience can choose to look
into the pool, all others simply lack the curiosity to bother!
64 Screaming Walls
Faces appear in the walls of one randomly determined building and
start to emit a piercing shriek. Any warband members within 8" of
the building take a S1 hit (no armor saves allowed) and are at -1 on
all to hit rolls (close combat and shooting) while the screaming lasts.
Spellcasters are even more sensitive to the noise than others and so
no spells may be cast from within this radius. Roll a D3 to determine
how many game turns the screaming lasts.
65 Peddler

No matter which turn it is rolled on, this encounter happens at the
end of the game. The winning warband sees a peddler wandering
through the ruins. This travelling merchant keeps his entire stock on
his back and offers to sell part of it to the warband. He has the
following items at half their normal price: mace, hammer, sword,
dagger, axe, helmet, crossbow, pistol, duelling pistol, rope & hook,
any poison, lucky charm, blessed water, hunting arrows, garlic,
healing herbs, holy (or unholy) relic, lantern and Mordheim map.
Roll a D3 for each item to find the quantity the peddler carries.
66 Itsy-Bitsy Spider
The presence of the wyrdstone has mutated this common household
pest into a monster of titanic proportions! This Gigantic Spider has
the following characteristics:
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Spider 5 3 0 5 4 4 1 2 10
Fearsome Beast: The Gigantic Spider causes fear.
Chitinous Hide: It has an armor save of 4+.
Poisonous Bite: Any to wound rolls of 5 or 6 (rather than just a 6)
are treated as critical hits.
The Gigantic Spider moves from the table edge it starts from to the
opposite table edge, attacking any warband members that get in its
path.

#### Power in the Stones

By Daniel Carlson
“Of course there’s magic in those stones... but it is dark magic, and only the desperate or the foolish would seek to
use it. Woe to us that our times are rich in both desperation and fools.” – Fabergus Reinhardt, Witch Hunter
The value of the wyrdstone shards is not simply the coin that
nobles and merchants are willing to pay for them. It is a well-
known fact that the stones are rich in magic, and they are said
to grant a variety of powers to those that learn to use them.
Tales are told among the common folk of stones that caused a
certain farmer’s harvest to double, or of the stone that made
old Herr Grutenbauer's dog speak like a man. True or not,
these tales hint at the powerful and chaotic forces at work in
the stones. The most common use for the stones’ magic has
to do with the discovery of the famed alchemist van Hoffman
of Reikland. It was he who first observed that Wyrdstone can
serve as a catalyst in the transmutation of base metals into
gold. This usage of the stones has come to be the primary
obsession of those who seek it, for many are willing to pay
princely sums for stones that will make them an even larger
fortune. Yet there are those who continue to seek the stones
for their more arcane uses, and even mercenaries have been
known to keep a stone or two that was thought to bring luck,
healing, or other magical benefits.
Yet the stones are ultimately the work of Chaos, and those
who seek to use them often learn to fear their magic rather
than harness it. For every tale of a harvest that doubled, there
are two about the harvests that rotted in the field when
exposed to the strange glow of the stones; and for every tale
of a dog that learned to speak like a man there are darker tales
of animals that turned into a gruesome parody of a man-beast.
The tales of magical healings are mixed with many of
mutation and death brought on by exposure to the stones. Yet
greed is the downfall of many in the City of the Damned, and
the greed for power is perhaps the greatest of all...
Note: Witch Hunters, Sisters of Sigmar, Bretonnians, High
Elf Shadow Warriors and Dwarfs are all too aware of the
corrupting power of the stones, and will not make use of
them under any circumstances.

##### Evaluating Stones

Instead of selling or storing all of a warband's wyrdstone
shards, a player may choose to have one or more of their
stones evaluated by an alchemist for useful magical
properties. This is done during the trading phase of the post-
battle sequence (consequently, this means if a stone is chosen
to be evaluated and yields no special power, it cannot
subsequently be sold until after the next battle). Instead of
searching for a rare item, a hero may take one shard of the
warband’s wyrdstone to an alchemist. Numerous alchemists
have flocked to Mordheim to study the stones, and they ply
their trade from tents and wagons in the encampments around
the city. Alchemists are known for their greed, however, and
they do not provide their services for free; for each stone
evaluated, the warband must pay 20 gold crowns. When the
stone is evaluated, roll 2D6 on the chart opposite:

2 Spell Stone. Any model who carries this stone into battle
may cast one randomly determined spell for the duration of
the battle, using the normal rules for spell casting. The spell
should be determined at random from the Lesser Magic spell
list, and a different spell should be generated before each
game in which the stone is used. This means the stone will
be more useful in certain battles than others, depending on
which spell it happens to provide for that game.
3 Stone of Regeneration. Any model who caries this stone
into battle will regenerate lost wounds at a rate of one
Wound regained each recovery phase. A model carrying this
stone treats all stunned results it suffers on the Injury Chart
as knocked down.
4 Stone of Might. A model who carries this stone into battle
will have one characteristic increased for the duration of the
battle. Roll a D6 to see which characteristic is affected
before each battle:
1 +1 Initiative 2 +1 Movement
3 +1 Strength 4 +l Toughness
5 +1 Attacks 6 +1 Wounds
Note that this temporary boost may take a characteristic
above normal racial maximums.
5 Stone of Warding. A model who carries this stone will not
be affected by hostile magic spells on a D6 roll of 4+.
6-8 No beneficial powers.
9 Stone of Luck. A model who carries this stone may re-roll
any dice roll he makes once per game. The second roll must
be taken. This power may not be combined with other 'luck
enhancements' like the spell Luck of Shemtek to yield re-
rolls on top of re-rolls, though it may be used to give a
model affected by these enhancements one additional re-roll
during the battle as normal.
10 Stone of Skill. A model who carries this stone into battle
will have one characteristic increased for the duration of the
battle. Roll a D6 to see which characteristic is affected
before each battle:
1-2+1 Weapon Skill 3-4+1 Ballistic Skill 5-6+1 Leadership
Note that this temporary boost may take a characteristic
above normal racial maximums.
11 Stone of Healing. A model who carries this stone may heal
one model within 2" of him (including himself) during each
recovery phase. The warrior regains one lost Wound. Note
that this healing is only beneficial to models who have more
than one Wound on their profile.
12 Stone of Protection. A model who carries this stone has
their armor save improved by one point (i.e. a 5+ save
becomes a 4+ save). Note that no model may ever have a
save better than 1+. If the model has no armor, the stone
gives him a 6+ armor save.

###### Using Stones

Stones may only be used by heroes, just like other equipment.
No hero may ever carry more than one stone at a time (the
combined Chaotic magic would instantly turn them into
Chaos Spawn). Using a wyrdstone’s power is always a
dangerous undertaking and to represent this, after every
battle, each hero who carried a stone must make a check to
see if they have been adversely affected by their usage of the
stone’s power. Make the check by rolling 2D6 for each hero:
a roll of 2, 3, 11 or 12 indicates that they have been affected.
Skaven, having a natural tolerance for warpstone, are only
affected on the roll of 2 or 12. Roll a D6 on the following
chart over the page to see what has happened to affected
models.
1 Spawn! The model has succumbed to the raw mutating
force of Chaos, and becomes a terrible Chaos Spawn. See
'Becoming a Chaos Spawn' below.
2 Weakened. The model has lost some of its life force to the
stone. One of the model's characteristics is permanently
reduced by one. Roll 2D6 to see which characteristic suffers:
1-2 Movement 3 Weapon Skill
4 Ballistic Skill 5-6 Strength
7-8 Toughness 9-10 Initiative
11-12 Leadership
If any characteristic is reduced to 0 as a result of the
weakening, the model becomes a Chaos Spawn. See
'Becoming a Chaos Spawn' below.
3-4 Sickened. Exposure to the stone's magic has made the
warrior physically ill. He must miss the next battle while he
recovers.
5-6 Mutation! The corrupting power of Chaos has caused the
model to gain a mutation. Roll on the Random Mutation
Table (see below).

###### Becoming a Chaos Spawn

Chaos Spawn are the wretched remains of one who has tasted
the power of Chaos and proved unable to withstand its
mutating touch. Wracked with waves of mutation and
change, a warrior is reduced to a monstrous beast of fangs,
tentacles, eyeballs, and other horrific growths. Their mind is
forever shattered, and they become a gibbering and mindless
servant of Chaos. Typically, when a being meets this fate, his
former comrades will put him out of his misery with a swift
death... unless that seems like too dangerous a task to
attempt, in which case they will simply herd the beast away
down one of Mordheim’s winding alleys or into the sewers.
There are, however, some who have a desire for and affinity
with Chaos Spawn that allows them to keep their mutated
friend among their ranks as a weapon and pet to use against
their enemies.
If one of your heroes becomes a Chaos Spawn he is
considered to be lost to the warband, unless your warband is
from the Cult of the Possessed or Skaven. Followers of
Chaos have a sort of semi-reverence for these mindless
beasts, and the Skaven have long been adept at training and
using the products of wyrdstone-induced mutation.
When the hero ‘Spawns’, any armor they were wearing is
lost in the storm of violent mutation that overtakes the
unfortunate warrior. Weapons and equipment are abandoned
by the creature, however, and may be reclaimed by the
warband. The new Spawn retains its previous characteristic
profile and any existing mutations, and immediately gains an
additional D6 mutations which should be generated on the

Random Mutation Table. If the hero was previously a spell
caster, all spell casting ability is lost. If the model became a
Spawn as the result of a characteristic being taken down to
zero, that characteristic becomes a 1 on the Spawn’s profile.
The Spawn's Movement characteristic may be deleted, as the
Spawn is now subject to a special rule that governs its
movement on the table top. The Spawn is now subject to the
following special rules:
Fear: The Spawn now causes fear.
Psychology: The Spawn is immune to all psychology rules.
Movement: Instead of normal movement, each movement
phase, the Spawn moves 2D6" towards any enemy model.
The Spawn must move straight towards an enemy, though
this need not be the nearest enemy, and may be an enemy the
Spawn cannot even see (Spawn have a plethora of senses,
magical and otherwise that tell them where their foes are). If
this movement brings the Spawn into contact with any model,
friend or foe, the Spawn immediately attacks it, and will
continue to fight in following rounds until the other model
has been taken out of action or fled. Spawn may move up
ladders and stairs, and may even attempt to climb walls
subject to the normal climbing rules.
The Spawn will not gain any experience points from future
battles; it is far too mindless to learn from its actions.
The Spawn should be represented by an appropriate model.
While this could be one of the Chaos Spawn models from the
Warhammer line, it's probably more satisfying and fun to
make your own. Spawn are the ultimate you-can-do-no-
wrong conversion project, where you can throw together all
sorts of stray bits to make a really unique model.
###### Random Mutation Table

Mordheim is a city under the sway of Chaos, and with Chaos
comes mutation and change. There are numerous ways by
which a warrior can be afflicted with mutation, and there are
some who actually seek out mutation as a 'reward’ of the
Chaos Powers. While mutations are not always harmful, and
indeed can often be helpful, they are a mark of Chaos, and as
such those who bear them are feared, shunned and persecuted
throughout the Empire.
The following is a table used to generate the colourful,
exotic, and sometimes debilitating mutations that will be
visited upon certain warriors at certain times (i.e. as a result
of exposure to Wyrdstone, for example). The table may also
prove useful to Game Masters who want to quickly generate
some interesting mutants for a special scenario. The table
uses a D66 roll, just like the Heroes Serious Injuries table in
the rulebook. If the mutant rolls a mutation that it already
possesses, re-roll it until a new mutation is generated.
Note: The great danger of mutation is that it will ultimately
overwhelm the victim with the corrupting power of Chaos,
reducing them to a monstrous and mindless Chaos Spawn. To
represent this danger, if a warrior ever has a characteristic
reduced to zero as the result of a mutation, they immediately
degenerate into a loathsome Chaos Spawn (see the full rules
for Chaos Spawn above).
Any member of a human, mercenary warband (this includes
both Ostlanders and Averlanders) that receives a mutation
marked with * is immediately drummed out of the warband
by his suspicious peers. Remove the hero from the roster, his
equipment is lost.
(knights_templar@hotmail.com) Page 312 Assembled by Paul H


Random Mutation Table
Roll a D66
11 Acid Spray*: The mutant can spit acid at its foes. The acid spray
uses the mutant’s Ballistic Skill to hit, just as if the mutant were
firing a missile weapon. The spray has a range of 8", and a Strength
of 4. The mutant does not suffer any penalty for spraying a target at
long range, nor does the mutant suffer any penalty for moving and
spraying in the same turn.
12 Atrophy: A part of the mutant’s body has become shrivelled and
atrophied. Roll a D6:
1 Head - The mutant is now subject to stupidity.
2-4 Arm - The mutant loses the usage of one arm. The
mutant may only use a single one-handed weapon from
now on. If both arms are lost the mutant must be retired
from the warband unless it possesses a tail or bite attack
of some kind.
5-6 Leg - The mutant loses the usage of one leg. Divide the
mutant's Movement in half, rounding up. If both legs are
lost, the mutant must be retired from the warband.
13 Beaked*: The mutant has a beak like that of a bird or octopus,
though its other facial features remain unchanged. Unless the mutant
already possesses a bite attack, the mutant may make an additional
attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase due to its vicious bite.
14 Beweaponed Extremities*: The mutant’s hands are turned into
weapons! The mutant may no longer use other weapons or
equipment that would require the usage of hands.
On the plus side, it no longer has to worry about being caught
without a weapon! The mutant will gain the normal extra attack in
hand-to-hand for using an additional hand weapon, and the weapon
extremities follow the normal rules for weapons of their type (i.e.
sword extremities may be used to parry).
Roll a D6 for each arm to see what it becomes:
1-2 sword, 3-4 mace, 5-6 axe.
If the mutant grows two sword extremities, it may re-roll failed
parries just as if it had a sword and a buckler.
15 Blackblood: If the model loses a wound in close combat, anyone
in base contact with the model suffers a Strength 3 hit (no critical
hits) from the spurting corrosive blood.
16 Brightly Patterned Skin*: The mutant's skin becomes brightly
coloured with contrasting stripes, spots, or other patterns. No effect
on play, but a great excuse to paint an interesting new model!
21 Burning Body*: The mutant's body is constantly burning with
flickering tongues of hellish flame and burns with unnatural light.
The warrior may not carry any weapons or armor unless they are
magical, or forged from Gromril or Ithilmar. The mutant does not
suffer the usual penalties for fighting with his fists (no -1 to the
mutant's Strength, enemies do not add +l to armor saves). The
mutant always counts as having a lantern. Any model in base
contact with the mutant suffers an automatic Strength 2 hit at the
beginning of each close combat phase. The flames cannot cause
critical hits.
22 Cloud of Flies: The mutant is permanently surrounded by a great
swirling mass of flies. Opponents in close combat with the mutant
are at -1 on all to hit rolls, as the flies buzz into eyes, noses, and
mouths.
23 Cloven Hooves*: The warrior gains +l Movement.
24 Crystalline Body*: The mutant's body becomes living crystal,
which is tough, but easily shattered. The mutant's Toughness
becomes 6, while its Wounds become 1.
Neither of these attributes can subsequently be altered by experience
or mutation. If an experience advance indicates a change in one of
these characteristics, re-roll the advance until a different
characteristic advance is obtained.

25 Elastic Limbs*: The mutant's arms can stretch out, allowing the
mutant to attack from a distance. If the mutant is not in base contact
with an enemy model at the beginning of the hand-to-hand combat
phase, it may make one hand-to-hand attack against a single visible
enemy within 6" of the mutant. The enemy does not get a chance to
fight back.
26 Enormously Fat: The mutant becomes enormously fat and
bloated. Divide its Movement in half, rounding up; add +1 to its
Toughness; and reduce its Initiative by 1.
31 Extra Arm*: The mutant may use any single-handed weapon in
the extra arm, giving him +1 attack when fighting in hand-to-hand
combat. Alternatively, he may carry a shield or buckler in the extra
arm. If a mutant who is unable to use weaponry (i.e. Possessed,
Chaos Spawn, etc.) gains this mutation, they simply gain an extra
attack; they are still not permitted to use weapons.
32 Extremely Thin: The mutant becomes a matchstick figure,
sickly thin and bony. Divide its Toughness in half, rounding up.
33 Eyestalks*: The mutant has stalked eyes, similar to a crab. The
mutant now causes fear.
34 Fangs*: The mutant grows huge fangs, giving it an extra bite
attack (unless it already has one) in each hand-to-hand combat
phase. The bite attack uses the mutant's normal Strength.
35 Furry*: The mutant grows a covering of long, dense fur. The
mutation changes the mutant's appearance only; and has no effect on
its profile.
36 Great Claw*: One of the mutant's arms ends in a great, crab-like
claw. He may carry no weapons in this arm, but gains an extra
attack in hand-to-hand combat with a +1 Strength bonus.
41 Hideous: The mutant causes fear, and is seldom invited to
parties.
42 Horns*: The mutant's head grows horns, and it gains an extra
gore attack in hand-to-hand combat at the mutant's normal Strength
The mutant may no longer wear a helmet.
43 Iron Hard Skin*: The mutant's skin is covered in iron and steel
scales. The mutant's armor save is improved by +1 (i.e. a 5+ save
becomes a 4+). Note that a warrior's armor save may never
improve to better than a 1+ save. If the mutant has no armor, their
skin alone gives them a 6+ armor save.
44 Mace Tail*: The mutant grows a flexible tail with a mace-like
bony tip. Unless it already has a tail, the mutant gains an extra tail
attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase at the mutant's Strength
+1. If the mutant already has a tail, it will have to decide at the
beginning of each hand-to-hand phase which tail it wishes to use.
45 Moronic: The mutant's mind shrinks. The mutant is now subject
to stupidity.
46 Plague Bearer*: The mutant carries a hideous, Chaos-tainted
disease. The mutant's limbs are covered in open sores, and the
mutant is dramatically weakened by its condition.
Reduce the mutant's Movement and Initiative by -1. Any time the
mutant hits an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, there is a chance they
have infected their foe with this debilitating disease: the enemy
model must roll equal to or less than its Toughness on a D6 to avoid
contracting the sickness. If the roll is higher than the model's
Toughness, they suffer the -1 to Movement and Initiative penalty for
the rest of the battle, (after which it is assumed they get immediate
herbal remedies and plenty of rest to keep the disease from setting in
permanently!). The Plague Bearer may not infect the same model
more than once in a single battle. In addition, the Plague Bearer's
ghastly appearance means it now causes fear.
Assembled By Paul H Page 313 (knights_templar@hotmail.com)


51 Poisonous Bite: The mutant grows small fangs which can secrete
a potent poison.
Unless the warrior already has a bite attack, it gains an extra attack
in each hand-to-hand combat phase due to its deadly bite. The
poisonous bite is a Strength 5 attack, but is reduced to Strength 2 if
the target of the bite is immune to poison. If the mutant already
possesses a bite attack, it is simply upgraded to include the
poisonous effect described above.
52 Prehensile Tail*: The mutant grows a prehensile tail. Unless the
mutant already has a tail attack, he gains an additional attack with
this tail in each hand-to-hand combat phase. The mutant may hold
and use any singlehanded weapon in the tail, or alternatively, he
may carry and use a shield or buckler with it. If a mutant with other
tail attacks does use an equipped prehensile tail in a hand-to-hand
combat phase, he may not use any of his other tail attacks during
that phase; a single tail must be selected for use at the beginning of
each hand-to-hand phase. If a mutant unable to use weaponry (i.e.
Possessed, Chaos Spawn, etc.) gains this mutation, they simply gain
an extra attack (unless they already possess a tail attack); they
remain unable to use weapons.
53 Regeneration: The mutant can often heal instantly from wounds
it suffers in battle. When the mutant suffers one or more Wounds, it
may try to regenerate the damage. Roll a D6: on the roll of a 4+, the
mutant has instantly healed itself back to full Wounds. If less than a
4 is rolled, the mutant's regenerative powers have been temporarily
exhausted, and it may not attempt further regenerations for the
remainder of the battle.
54 Resilient: The mutant's skin thickens, or becomes scaly, or
otherwise increases its resilience to damage. Increase the mutant's
Toughness by +1.

55 Scorpion Tail*: The mutant has a long barbed tail with an
envenomed tip, allowing him to make an extra Strength 5 attack in
each hand-to-hand combat phase (unless the mutant already has a
tail attack, in which case it will have to select a single one of its
available tail attacks in each hand-to-hand phase). If the model hit
by the tail is immune to poison, the Strength of the hit is reduced to
2.
56 Skull Face*: The flesh of the mutant's face dissolves, leaving a
skull. The mutant now causes fear.
61 Spines*: Any model in base contact with the mutant suffers an
automatic Strength 1 hit at the beginning of each close combat
phase. Spines will never cause critical hits.
62 Stunted: The mutant's body becomes hunchbacked and stiffened.
Reduce the mutant's Movement and Initiative by -1.
63 Suckers*: The mutant's limbs are covered in adhesive suckers.
The mutant automatically passes Initiative tests when climbing.
64 Tentacle*: One of the mutant's arms ends in a tentacle. He may
grapple his opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks by -1,
down to a minimum of 1. The mutant may decide which attack his
opponent loses.
65 Warts: The mutant is covered in repellent warts. The mutant's
profile is unaffected.
66 Wings*: The mutant grows a pair of feathered or bat-like wings.
The wings are not strong enough to allow the mutant to fly in the
proper sense, but they do allow the mutant to glide down from an
elevated position. If the mutant is above the table-top surface (on a
roof, walkway, etc.) it may glide down at a rate of 2" horizontally
for each inch of downward vertical movement.

#### Encampments

These rules are based from the ones by Steven Gibbs
Since the cataclysm that smashed the city of Mordheim, crude shantytowns have cropped up beyond the crumbling city walls. At first these
pitiful settlements housed the sparse remnants of Mordheim’s population. However, as soon as word reached the other towns and cities of
the Empire of the magical Wyrdstone that could be found in the blackened shell of Mordheim, the treasure seekers came. The existing
settlements were practically overrun by bands of mercenaries and bandits who would set up their camps in whatever tumbledown buildings
were available or pitch their tents behind crude barricades. Soon there was a flood of greedy souls, many of which were not human as the
stench of Wyrdstone tempted many from afar.
There are three main settlements in and around Mordheim. Sigmarhaven is inhabited mainly by the loyal followers of Sigmar and is a place
of law and relative order. It also attracts a large following of Witch Hunters and their ilk, and understandably mutants and the Possessed are
not tolerated there. Paid and equipped watchmen are maintained for the security of those who camp within it. There are, though, far more
lawless settlements around Mordheim where scum such as Orcs and even the Possessed are known to walk freely. Nowhere is more infamous
than thrice cursed Cutthroat’s Den. Here life is cheap and the only law is that of the sword. Although a foul and dangerous place, there are
many things that can be bought and sold here because of the shady sorts this place attracts. The last place even the toughest, most brutal of
scum would think twice before making their camp there is within the haunted ruins of Mordheim itself. The dead are said to walk here and
the foul servants of the Shadow Lord are everywhere, waiting to claim the souls of the unwary. There are those, however, that brave the
mutant infested cursed city even after nightfall but then again they seem quite suited to it. Foul Ratmen scurry about the sewers,
Necromancers make their homes, confidant that the foolish righteous won’t disturb their unholy practices and, of course, the children of the
Shadow Lord, the Possessed, claim the ruins as their domain.

##### Experimental Rules

When starting a new campaign, all players must decide or not
to use the encampment rules. Only after their first battle may
each player then try to find a settlement and make camp.
First, they must decide which of the settlements they wish to
set up camp in (obviously dependent upon which settlements
will let them in!) or if they want to risk actually staying in the
cursed city. When you decide where you want them to stay.
A warband may only have one camp at a time and may only
reroll for a new camp if they lose their original one or they
have upgraded to a new site after three rounds. Any effects
that a camp provides start after the warband’s next battle.
After each battle you may find out if you gain income, if
other warriors join the warband, or if repairs need be made to
the camp.
After each battle you may choose to visit locations within the
settlement to procure goods and entertainment. If you don’t,
you may use the Trading chart as normal. Different locations
can help you find items, receive healing, make money or
other things. Between location visits, you must roll on the
Events table to find out what happens to the warband as it
carouses around the town.

##### Special Rules

Warband Size: With a camp to call home many warriors
will come knotting. The size of the warband may increase to
three times greater than the warband’s maximum starting
size. Also your warband may have up to twice the number of
marked heroes (other than the Leader) and henchmen groups,
also you may have up to 5 model with the ‘Lad’s Got Talent’,
However the normal maximum on a warband will apply
when fighting a Scenario (only if Scenario: Defend the
Camp, then the whole warband may be used.)
Upkeep Cost: Any Hired Sword which is left behind at the
encampment will only charge haft the standard upkeep for
that battle. Hired swords that are recovering from wounds
may only charge haft the standard upkeep, roll a D6 for each
wounded Hired Sword on a 4+ he will not charge for upkeep.
Any Dramatis Personae will not wait around in some camp,
so if a Dramatis Personae if left behind they will leave the
warband.

##### Types of Encampment

Barracks: The Barracks are used by most of the Human
warbands, Any Mercenaries warbands increasing the
maximum number of warband member by +1 model.
Caves: There are many caves found all around Mordheim,
and most of these caves are home to some sort of monsters.
The caves are commonly used by the Beastmen raiders and
Green-skins warbands. But the Cults of the Possessed also
have been known to uses the caves. Beastmen raiders may
recruit a Minotaur at haft the normal price. Green-skins may
recruit a Troll at haft the normal price. If the cave is used by

Churches: The church is a holy place for many warbands
and for some an unholy place. Witch Hunter & Sister of

or Wolf Priest at haft the normal hiring cost, upkeep is as
normal. The church may be fitted with bell tower. This act as
a scout tower and have the following special rule:
Church Bells - Then defending the base camp, the defender may
ring the church bells at the start of the assault phase. If rung all
defending model gain a +1 Initiative and cause fear for that turn
(this may be rung in the attacker’s turn). At the end of turn roll a D6
on a 5+ the bell breaks from it mountings, the bell cannot be used
for the rest of the game, and will cost 25 gold crown to repair and
the upkeep increases by +2D6 for each time the bell breaks.

liking. With nice mausoleums and plenty of corpses. The
grave corpses tend to be better preserved and good for
reanimating, this encampment has the following special rule:
Grave Robbing - The income of a warband that set up in a
Crypt/Mausoleum and Grave Robbing will increase to 3D6. Undead
warbands will dig up suitable corpses on a 9 or less.

trading chart.
Safe House (Sister of Sigmar only): The Save Houses are
only used be the Sister of Sigmar. The house comes with a
fence, wall or some other barrier to keep out riffraff. The Safe

camp in. It even has some nice tunnels running off of it to
who knows where. Skaven may have an extra rat ogre.
Allows up to three Henchmen group to be held in reserve at

##### Income

The warbands can be supplement their income, members of a
warband which stay behind can work to gain extra income or

on location of encampment, type of encampment and type of
warband.
Working the land: Any member of the warband may work
the common farmland, for each member of the warband

if the roll is 7 or less then they have dug up a corpse suitable
to become a Zombie, one zombie should be added free to the
warband Roster.
##### Hired Help

With an encampment setup, a warband may hire some help
from the locals to employ their skills for the warband. Your
warband may get the help from a displace Beast Handle,
Blacksmith, Cartographer, Fletcher, or Gunsmith. Each hired

Blacksmith 50 GC 15 GC
Cartographer 15 GC 5 GC
Fletcher 45 GC 15 GC
Gunsmith 45 GC 15 GC
Merchant 30 GC 10 GC
##### Locations

After each battle you may choose to visit locations within the
settlement to procure goods and entertainment. If you don’t,
you may use the Trading chart as normal. Different locations
can help you find items, receive healing, make money or
other things. Between location visits you must roll on the
Events table to find out what happens to the warband as it
carouses around the town.

A Visit to the Apothecary
Each warrior may only attempt to get treatment for one injury
at a time, and only one attempt at treatment per Hero may be
made during each post battle sequence. The cost for treatment
will vary from location to location per attempt (one attempt =
one roll on the table), and this money must be paid before
rolling on the table – Mordheim physicians demand payment
in advance, while the patient is still capable of doing so!
When you visit an Apothecary you may add +1 to find the
drugs or potions that you are looking for.
Necromancers often visit the surgeon looking for body parts
and bodies for their creations and zombies. A necromancer
may stop by the surgeon to find bodies for zombies and
reanimate them. Roll a d6 if you roll a 6 you may add a
zombie to your warband at 1/2 the cost.
The following injuries cannot be treated: Chest Wound,
Blinded in One Eye, and Old Battle Wound. They are

grave.
The following injuries use the Limb Surgery table: Leg
Wound, Smashed Leg, and Hand Injury.
The following injuries use the Brain Surgery table:
Madness and Nervous Condition.

Surgery table
2D6 Result
2-3 ‘Someone fetch a priest!’
The unfortunate patient has expired due to excessive blood
loss. The Hero is dead and must be stricken from the
warband record, but his equipment is retained by the
warband.
4 ‘This has got to come off!’
The surgeon has felt the need to amputate, ostensibly to
‘keep the rot out’. If a leg was being treated, the model now
has its Movement halved (rounding up); if a hand was being
treated, the warrior may only use a single-handed weapon
from now on.
5-6 ‘Sorry, lad!' Done my best!’
The surgery was unsuccessful, and the warrior must miss the
next battle while he recovers.
7-8 ‘No luck!’
The surgery was unsuccessful.
9-10 ‘Mind you stay off it for a bit!’
The surgery was successful! The warrior may remove the
injury and its adverse effects from his profile. He must,
however, miss the next battle while he recovers.
11-12 ‘Shallaya be praised!’
The surgery was a complete success! The warrior may
remove the injury and its adverse effects from his profile.

Brain Surgery table
2D6 Result
2-3 ‘Someone fetch a priest!’
The physician has been a bit too zealous in his treatment.
The Hero is dead and must be stricken from the warband
record, but his equipment is retained by the warband.
4-5 ‘Erm... that’s not right!’
The treatment has not only failed to help the warrior, it has
actually worsened his condition! The warrior is now subject
to Stupidity. If the warrior was being treated for Stupidity,
there is no change in his condition (except perhaps, a bit
more drooling than usual).
6 ‘A bit unhinged, that one!’
The treatment has failed, and the warrior emerges from the
treatment as something of a raving lunatic. The warrior
suffers a -1 Initiative penalty (down to a minimum of 1). He
is now so unsettling to behold that he causes fear.
7-8 ‘Sorry lad! Done my best!’
The treatment was unsuccessful, and the warrior must miss
the next battle while he recovers.
9-10 ‘A bit of rest, and you’ll be fine!’
The treatment was successful! The warrior may remove the
injury and its adverse effects from his profile. He must,
however, miss the next battle while he recovers.
11-12 ‘Shallaya be praised!’
The treatment was a complete success! The warrior may
remove the injury and its adverse effects from his profile.

Cartographer
A cartographer will help the band with their exploration. He
also carries many different maps. You may purchase maps
here without searching for them but the rules for maps from
the Mordheim rulebook still apply. The cartographer is also a
wealth of little titbits of information that he is willing to sell.
Most of it is useless but some isn’t. If you pay him 5 GC he
will divulge some of this info to you.
Roll a D6 on the following chart:
1 You may re-roll one of your Exploration dice after the next
battle.
2-5 The information was interesting but utterly useless.
6 You may increase or decrease the result of one Exploration
dice by 1 after the next battle.

Fletcher
The fletcher is a master at making bows and arrows, along
with other missile weapons. He does not have the craft or
know how to create Black Powder weapons though. When
you visit a fletcher you may add +2 to find the missile

weapon you are looking for (this does not count towards
Black Powder weapons though).
Smithy
Hearty blacksmiths work at the smithy where they fashion all
kinds of metals into a variety of useful items. Mainly though
they create weapons and armor. When visiting a blacksmith
you may add +2 to your Search rolls when trying to find
armor or close combat weapons.
Muleskinner
A beast master takes care of the animals. He feeds, houses
and trains horses, ponies and dogs. He reduces the difficulty
of finding animals by adding +2 to your dice roll on the
Trading chart.
Merchant
The merchant is a purveyor of a great variety of goods. He
sells just about anything that’s not nailed down. The
merchant gives you +1 to find Rare items.

Drinking Den
This is a tavern where you may play a game of chance, look for new recruits or just get smashed! You may gamble at any time
in the Dancing Pig. To find out what else you can do, roll a D6 and consult the following chart.
D6 Effects
1 Drugged. One of your Heroes (select randomly) partakes of
a curious drink offered to him by a stranger. After one swig
he feels the effect of the liquid take hold – he has been
drugged! Roll a D6 on the following table:
1-3 Your Hero has been poisoned and is at -1 Toughness
for the duration of the next battle.
4-6 The liquid in question is actually a very strong ale, and
your hero quickly gains a taste for it. He wakes up the
next morning with a pounding head.
2-3 Taken with the joys of hot food and a good too many bottles
of Bugman’s, your leader and his men overspend on such
luxuries by D6x10 GC.
4-5 Hireling. Whilst carousing in the bar you meet many
different characters and warriors. You sit down to have a
few drinks with some. Roll a D6 on the following chart:
1 You are drinking with a Halfling who, impressed with
your propensity for ale, offers you his services at half
the normal rate for the next battle.
2 An Ogre challenges you to a drinking contest. Roll a
D6:
1-4 He drinks you under the table – you wake the next
day with a terrible hangover.
5-6 You drink him under the table and he is in such
awe that he offers you his services for the next
battle for free.
3 You sit down with a mysterious Elven Ranger and
start to tell tales of your exploits. One of your tales
moves him so much, he offers you his services at half
the cost for the next battle.
4 You sit down and share a drink with a Freelancer. As
the night wears on you find that he and your father
served in the same company together. He offers you
his services for the next battle for free.
5 You find yourself drinking with a young fellow who is
itching to test his metal in the Cursed City – you may
add an extra henchman to your party (not above your
warband’s maximum number of warriors however).
6 You sit with a fellow who looks battle hardened. As
you talk, you discover that the rest of his warband was
slain searching the ruins. You may ask him to join
your warband as a Hero. You may add a Hero to your
warband for free, although only if you haven’t got the
maximum number of Heroes already.
6 Bar Room Brawl. Your leader gets into an argument with
another patron in the tavern. The argument soon escalates
quickly. Roll a D6 on the following table:
1 Your leader is thrashed and must make an immediate
roll on the Injury table.
2 Your leader takes quite a beating and leaves D6 GC
poorer.
3 Your leader knocks the patron to the ground and takes
D6x3 GC from his purse for his impudence.
4 The patron is joined by his warband and an all-out
brawl ensues. Roll a D6: 1-4 you send the warband
fleeing and gain D6x5 GC, for your trouble. 5-6 you
are routed and lose D6x5 GC
5 The brawl attracts the attention of the watch, who
arrive to throw the patron in the stocks.
6 The brawl attracts the attention of the watch who
arrive to throw everyone into the stocks. You must pay
D6x10 GC to get everyone out.

Gambling
Your leader gets involved in a rather dubious game of dice.
Roll a D6 and consult the table below:
D6 Result
1 Your leader loses 3D6 GC and comes away a little wiser.
2-5 Your leader manages to break even.
6 Your leader gambles away a fortune before Lady Luck
smiles on him and he wins it all back with interest. Collect
3D6 GC in winnings.

##### Sigmarhaven

Sigmarhaven, bastion of hope and goodwill, is located to the
north-east of Mordheim where the River Stir still runs pure. It
is not the largest of the settlements around Mordheim but is
by far the safest. The settlement is surrounded by a wooden
palisade and has a well-armed militia, which is paid for and
maintained by tithes from all of the warbands that reside
there.
Sigmarhaven was originally founded by the Sigmar-fearing
folk who managed to flee the cursed city but has since
become the refuge of Witch Hunters and Reiklanders alike. A
makeshift wooden temple stands in the centre of this shanty
of wooden shacks and canvas tents, and the priests of Sigmar
preside over the settlement and deal with the day-to-day
running of the place. The centre of the settlement is a bustling
market place where traders and merchants can buy and sell
their wares – everything from food, ale and weapons to
horses and even Wyrdstone. Most honest, decent folk are
welcomed here from many of the Empire’s outlying
provinces, and even the odd Elf or Dwarf can be found
wandering around the morass of camps.
Who may camp here: The Warbands which are allowed the
stay inside the wall of Sigmarhaven are of a Lawful, Lawful /
Neutral or Neutral Alignment, apart from the Outlaw, Pit
Fighter and Norse Warbands.
Housing: Most of Sigmarhaven housing is of tents or small
wooden shacks, when a new warbands arrives they are
assigned a block, it is up the warband’s leader to work out
how to best use the block.
Apothecary Cost: 20 gold crowns per attempt
Special Rules:
Upkeep: For any warband residing within Sigmarhaven is
responsible for the upkeep and defence of the place – as a
result a tithe of two shards of Wyrdstone must be paid after
each battle.

here but it is only a safe house. Possessed are a rare site but
do appear at times.

at Brigandsburg apart from the Beastmen raiders.

##### Cutthroat’s Den

Cutthroat’s Den is a place of villainy and evil. It is located on
the west side of Mordheim. Anyone with gold is allowed in
and those without tend to find their hands in other people's
pockets.
Cutthroat’s Den does not have much in the range of defence
(it is up to the warband to defence themself). As for the City
Watch, it works for the City’s Crime boss and would only
defence itself.
There are a few brave souls (or fools as some have said) that
stay in Cutthroat to make money. The famous Twisted Goat
is located here. Despite being in a bad town the owner keeps
it clean and safe as brawls are at a minimum. The infamous
Pit resides in the centre of town. Many have lost their lives
here and many have made their fortunes. The slaver Ashen
Pettyflesh has a thriving business here. He sales any
humanoid for a price to anyone with the right amount of
money. When visiting Cutthroat’s Den you may find many
special locations. You may choose to skip visiting locations
and use the trading chart to get equipment.
Who may camp here: The warbands that are welcome (kind
of) at Cutthroat’s Den are Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral /
Chaotic, Chaotic Alignment, apart from the Beastmen
raiders.
